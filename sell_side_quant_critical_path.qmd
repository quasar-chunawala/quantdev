If you are an aspiring quantitative researcher, its important to expose yourself to a healthy mathematical diet. Do math early and often. Learn how to code early!

Sell-side quant interviews test fluid intelligence, the ability to use logic and intuition to crack quant puzzles. The bar for these interviews is certainly high, there is almost zero tolerance for mistakes. Most interviews consist of four stages:

- General brain-teasers and puzzles
- Math puzzles
- Programming/Algorithmic thinking skills (C++ language features, STL, Python)
- Deal Economics

## Quant Forums 

- [QuantNet](https://quantnet.com/) run by [Andy Nguyen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nguyenandy/)
- [quant.stackexchange.com](https://quant.stackexchange.com/)
- [Wilmott Forums](https://forum.wilmott.com/)
- [r/quant](https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/) on reddit
- [Mathematics and Finance](https://discord.gg/vqat3fjeJ4) server on Discord.

QuantNet is an extremely useful forum for aspirants looking to apply to a top school or break into the field. The collective knowledge and network connections on this website go a long way in reducing the information assymetry. QN also publishes [university rankings](https://quantnet.com/mfe-programs-rankings/) each year, offering detailed insights into placement and admission stats.

## Books

I suggest a critical path for learning basic financial mathematics and topics useful for front-office desk-quant roles.

Here are my [unofficial solutions](https://github.com/quasar-chunawala/real-analysis) to  Stephen Abbott's *Understanding Analysis*. 

KKOP was suggested to me by [Daniel Duffy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-j-duffy-phd-a6ab3912/), it remains, to date, a favorite introductory text on differential equations.

### Stochastic Calculus

- [A first course in Stochastic Calculus](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Course-Stochastic-Calculus-Applied-Undergraduate/dp/1470464888) by Louis Pierre Arguin
- [Arbitrage Theory in Continuous Time](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Arbitrage-Theory-Continuous-Oxford-Finance/dp/0198851618/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1F6V3IL469WWT&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.vE00KIRWxBln9jZ27mMlMzT_3HHqRBteplNra0_ysjWl7vpubsVd9rTlE4hmlEgWdxWo-yONOxVdMkeZhiZ7U1eSw7K60mSjWSN4l4MI64ynR0K6IyW-KMwJ-GlgPB3p.LQqQ_DAn3-E9dX17QeOztOqrPIQ1QpUSC0-LGTVjlLs&dib_tag=se&keywords=Arbitrage+Pricing+in+COntinuous+time&qid=1747499743&s=books&sprefix=arbitrage+pricing+in+continuous+time%2Cstripbooks%2C56&sr=1-1) by Bjork.

I really like LP's book, for it, interleaves rigor and intuition, written by a quant and trader.

Bjork reads really well. As an economist, he explains important results such as Fundamental Theorems of Asset Pricing (FTAP), Girsanov theorem, change of measure with such clarity.

I think that this is a really important subject and there are several cool use-cases for coroutines. A [coroutine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine) in the simplest terms is just a function that you can pause in the middle. Imagine that you are executing a function top-down and then just at some point in between, you'd like to say, I am going to hit the pause button here; going to return the control back to the caller. At a later point the caller will decide to resume the execution of the function right where you left off. Unlike a function therefore, coroutines are always stateful - you atleast need to remember where you left off in the function body. Usually, you also need to remember more than this; you need to remember the values of all of the local variables were at the point where you paused. As a consequence, *you can think of the coroutine you are calling not as a function in the classical sense of the term, but more like a factory function that actually returns the coroutine object back to you. And this coroutine object is the one that holds all the state, and which you can resume to continue the computation at a future time*.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n%load_ext itikz\n```\n:::\n\n\nCoroutines can simplify our code!

C++ implements the latter approach - stackless coroutines.\n\nWhen using coroutines, we are talking about cooperative multi-tasking. As a quick 101, in preemptive multitasking, a special hardware timer interrupt is sent to the CPU periodically, the register state of the currently running process is saved to the main memory (in a data-structure called the process context) and the OS kernel acquires control of the CPU. The OS scheduler uses a scheduling policy such as round-robin to schedule another process from the process queue, copies its context from main memory to the CPU registers and transfers control to it. This is called a context switch. In cooperative multitasking, each process/thread, once running decides for how long to keep the CPU, and (crucially) when it is time to give it up so that another thread can use it.\n\n### A simple example {.unnumbered}\n\nLet's start with a simple example. Let's say, you want to compute the Fibonacci sequence. First thing, that you'd do, is code up a function `fibo(int)` that returns a sequence in a vector.\n\n```cpp\n// Returns a vector containing the \n// first n elements of the Fibonacci \n// series: \n// 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...\nstd::vector<int> fibo(int n)\n{\n    std::vector<int> results{};\n    int a_prev{1}, a_curr{1};\n    int a_next{0};\n    results.push_back(a_prev);\n    results.push_back(a_curr);\n    for(int i=2;i<=n;++i)\n    {\n        a_next = a_prev + a_curr;\n        results.push_back(a_next);\n        a_prev = a_curr;\n        a_curr = a_next;\n    }\n\n    return results;\n}\n```\n\nThis naive implementation has a number of disadvantages. For example, this function will always require $O(n)$ storage. Fibonacci has a simple recursive equation, but if I have a complex computation, and I am only ever processing the numbers sequentially one at a time, then it makes no sense to pay for the entire $O(n)$ storage. Another problem is that, if you are dealing with an infinite range, then it becomes a lot harder to handle.\n\nA different way of implementing this would be as follows. Instead of our function returning a range in a `vector`, we are just going to return a `generator` object; this `generator` object has then a `next()` member function and then every call to the `next()` member function gives us back the next number in the sequence.\n\n```cpp\nstruct FiboGenerator\n{\n    // Successive calls to next()  \n    // return the numbers from the \n    // Fibonacci series\n    int next();\n}\n\n// Returns a new FiboGenerator object\n// that will start from the first \n// Fibonacci number\nFiboGenerator makeFiboGenerator();\n```\n\nThe interesting question is: Is `makeFiboGenerator()` a coroutine? And we really can't tell - it's an implementation detail. All we see is an interface. This is actually the most important thing about coroutines. From the outside, they just look and behave like functions. From the outside, there is no way to tell, whether they've been implemented using a coroutine or not. The only thing that we need to know as the user of this function is the interface of the object `FiboGenerator`.\n\n### The coroutine return type {.unnumbered}\n\nThe initial call to the coroutine function will produce this return object of a certain `ReturnType` and hand it back to the caller. The interface of this type is what is going to determine what the coroutine is capable of. Since coroutines are super-flexible, we can do a whole lot with this return object. If you have some coroutine, and you want to understand what it's doing, the first thing you should look at is the `ReturnType`, and what it's interface is. The important thing here is, we design this `ReturnType`. If you are writing a coroutine, you can decide, what goes into this interface.\n\n### How to turn a function into a coroutine? {.unnumbered}\n\nThe compiler looks for one of the three keywords in the implementation: `co_yield`, `co_await` and `co_return`.\n\n| Keyword | Action | State |\n|---------|--------|-------|\n| `co_yield` | Output | Suspended |\n| `co_return` | Output | Ended |\n| `co_await` | Input | Suspended |\n\n: Coroutine keywords and their effects\n\nIn the preceding table, we see that after `co_yield` and `co_await`, the coroutine suspends itself and after `co_return`, it is terminated (`co_return` is the equivalent of the `return` statement in the C++ function).\n\nA classical function starts executing when it's called and normally terminates with a `return` statement or just when the function's end is reached. A function runs from the beginning to end. It may call another function (or even itself if it is recursive) and it may throw exceptions or have different return points. But it always runs from the beginning to the end.\n\nA coroutine is different. A coroutine is a function that can suspend itself. The flow for a coroutine may be like the following pseudo-code:\n\n```cpp\nReturnType coroutine(){\n    do_something();\n    co_yield;\n    do_something_else();\n    co_yield;\n    do_more_work();\n    co_return;\n}\n```\n\nYou should think of the coroutine function not as a function in the classical sense, but rather as a factory function that returns a coroutine object and this coroutine object is the one that holds all the state, and one which you can resume to continue the computation later on.\n\n### Use-cases for coroutines {.unnumbered}\n\n**Asynchronous computation.** Suppose we are tasked with designing a simple echo server. We listen for incoming data from a client socket and we simply send it back to the client. At some point in our code for the echo server, we will have a piece of logic like below:\n\n```cpp\nvoid session(Socket sock){\n    char buffer[1024];\n    int len = sock.read({buffer});\n    sock.write({buffer,len});\n    log(buffer);\n}\n```\n\nWe create a `buffer`, then call the `read` that reads packets from the NIC and stores them in the buffer. The return value `len` will tell us how many bytes we read. Then, we shrink the `buffer` - we create a smaller one with `len` bytes and we write it back. Finally, we perform some logging. If we run it, it will probably work, but we certainly don't want to write a server like this. Say one of the clients requests communication and we are in a session. They say, they are ready to send the data, so we are blocking on the `read`, but maybe they send us this data in 2 minutes, or 5 minutes or even more. And other clients keep waiting.\n\nWhat we could do is start this session and run it in a separate thread. And this would work, because if this thread is blocked, and if there are other threads in this server, they would run in exchange during the wait time. If we have a threadpool, we'll just grab a thread from the threadpool, tell whatever system manages the pool to run this `session(Socket)` function there.\n\nThis solution is still far from ideal. These are operating system emulated threads and the OS will have to manage which threads get CPU time. It will have to preempt one thread, run another. This preemption will occur at random moments, when we least expect it. We could have data-races and likely require protection of a critical section/resource using mutexes.\n\nOne alternative is to use an asynchronous framework and rewrite our code as follows:\n\n```cpp\nvoid session(Socket sock){\n    struct State{ Socket sock; char buffer[1024]; };\n    \n    // Heap allocate the state\n    auto state = std::make_shared<State>(sock, buffer);\n\n    auto on_read_finished_callback = /* ... */\n\n    // Perform an asynchronous read \n    state->socket.async_read( state->buffer, \n                             on_read_finished_callback );\n}\n```\n\nThe `async_read()` call is a request to the framework, which says that we are interested in data being read to our buffer at some point convenient to the client. When this succeeds, call our `on_read_finished_callback`. So, we are just making this association at this point and the server can move on to doing other stuff.\n\nThe `read` operation may fail for a number of reasons, so a good approach would be supply two arguments to the `on_read_finished_callback`: (i) An error code (ii) The number of bytes received, if there were no errors. We can try to implement it, by checking the error-code.\n\n```cpp\nvoid session(Socket sock){\n    struct State{ Socket sock; char buffer[1024]; };\n    \n    // Heap allocate the state\n    auto state = std::make_shared<State>(sock, buffer);\n\n    auto on_read_finished_callback = [&state](\n        error_code ec, \n        size_t len\n    )\n    {\n        auto done = /* ... */\n        if(!ec)\n        {\n            // Perform an asynchronous write\n            state->socket.async_write( \n                state->buffer, \n                done \n            );    \n        }\n    }\n\n    // Perform an asynchronous read \n    state->socket.async_read( state->buffer, \n                             on_read_finished_callback );\n}\n```\n\nNow, we don't have exception handling, because we have spread our logic over a number of callbacks. We are only left with `if` statements. If the reading all went fine, we can write the data back by shrinking the buffer, requesting that the `write` is performed at some time, not necessarily now - maybe later. When this `write` is performed, we would like to call another callback `done`. We don't wait until this callback is called or `write` is performed. At this point, we just make an association. It is possible, that at a future time, the `write` succeeds and then the callback `done` is called. So, we have to define it.\n\n```cpp\nvoid session(Socket sock){\n    struct State{ Socket sock; char buffer[1024]; };\n    \n    // Heap allocate the state\n    auto state = std::make_shared<State>(sock, buffer);\n\n    auto on_read_finished_callback = [state](\n        error_code ec, \n        size_t len\n    )\n    {\n        auto done = [state](error_code ec, size_t len)\n        {\n            if(!ec)\n                log();\n        }\n        if(!ec)\n        {\n            // Perform an asynchronous write\n            state->socket.async_write( \n                state->buffer, \n                done \n            );    \n        }\n    }\n\n    // Perform an asynchronous read \n    state->socket.async_read( state->buffer, \n                             on_read_finished_callback );\n}\n```\n\n`done` has a similar structure. It takes two arguments - the error code that tells if the `write` went fine and the number of bytes written `len`. If there were no errors on `write` and everything went fine, we can do the logging. Implicitly, \n\nSo, the `session` makes two associations: \n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{On finishing read} &\\mapsto \\texttt{on\\_finished\\_read\\_callback} \\\\\n\\text{On finishing write} &\\mapsto \\texttt{done} \\\\\n\\text{Accepting a new client connection} &\\mapsto \\texttt{session}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAnd implicitly there is a third association even though we cannot see it here - this entire function `session` is most likely a callback, in response to an event like $\\text{On client connection established}$. So, the server will be many different associations of events to callbacks at different levels. \n\nPay attention to the `state`. We said that, we wanted to allocate it on the heap and manage it through a `shared_ptr`. We pass this `shared_ptr<State>` by value to every single callback. This way, I make sure that the last one who touches this session turns off the lights and deallocates `state`. \n\nWhile this is a toy-example, in real production code, there can be a long sequence of steps and calling lambdas inside lambdas can obfuscate the meaning of the code. We already see a weird inversion of control flow, when reading the code.\n\nOne thing to note before I go to coroutines is that, even though those things happen asynchronously, there is a sequence to it, that is not violated. We only perform a `write` when we know that the `read` has succeeded. We only perform the `log` after the `write` has succeeded. \n\n$$\n\\texttt{read} \\to \\texttt{write} \\to \\texttt{log}\n$$\n\nAs an application programmer we determine, when we yield control to the system other sessions. It's not that the system pre-empts this task. \n\nA coroutine implementation of the same echo'ing session would look like this:\n\n```cpp\nTask<void> session(Socket sock){\n    char buffer[1024];\n    int len = co_await sock.async_read({buffer});\n    co_await sock.async_write({buffer,len});\n    log(buffer);\n}\n```\n\nThis looks very similar to the sequential code, except that we use this `co_await` keyword. You have clear indication of the points where the coroutine will be suspended. Also, note that previously the function `session` returned `void`. Now, we are returning something - a `Task<void>`. This will be a handle to the coroutine and it's how the outside world will be communicating with the coroutine. \n\n**Suspended computation**. A second use-case is that coroutines support lazy evaluation. Just as in the fibonacci example, sometimes we want to avoid doing unecessary evaluation. Lazy evaluation doesn't do any work unless it's absolutely necessary. This can also potentially make your code more efficient. Lazy evaluation also supports programming with infinite lists. \n\n## The simplest coroutine\n\nThe following code is the simplest implementation of a coroutine:\n\n```cpp\n#include <coroutine>\nvoid coro_func(){\n    co_return;\n}\n\nint main(){\n    coro_func();\n}\n```\n\n[Compiler Explorer](https://compiler-explorer.com/z/W3GoWPoEs)\n\nOur first coroutine will just return nothing. It will not do anything else. Sadly, the preceding code is too simple for a functional coroutine and it will not compile. When compiling with `gcc 15.2`, we get the following error:\n\n```shell\n<source>: In function 'void coro_func()':\n<source>:4:5: error: unable to find the promise type for this coroutine\n    4 |     co_return;\n      |     ^~~~~~~~~\n```\n\nLooking at C++ reference, we see that the return type of a coroutine must define a type named `promise_type`. \n\n### The `promise_type`\n\nWhy do we need a promise? The `promise_type` is the second important piece in the coroutine mechanism. We can draw an analogy from futures and promises which are essential blocks for achieving asynchronous programming in C++. The future is the thing, that the function that does the asynchronous computation, hands out back to the caller, that the caller can use to retrieve the result by invoking the `get()` member function. The future has the role of the return object. But, you need something that remains on the producer-side. The asynchronous function holds on to the promise, and that's where it puts the results that will be given to the caller, when it calls `get()` on the future. The idea behind the `promise_type` for coroutines is similar. The promise is where the coroutine's return value is stored, and it provides functions to control the coroutine's behavior at startup and completion of t he coroutine. The promise is the interface through which the caller interacts with the coroutine.\n\nFollowing the reference advice, we can write a new version of our coroutine.\n\n```cpp\n#include <coroutine>\nstruct Task\n{\n    struct promise_type\n    {\n    };\n};\n\nTask coro_func(){\n    co_return;\n}\n\nint main(){\n    coro_func();\n}\n```\n[Compiler Explorer](https://compiler-explorer.com/z/G957defsr)\n\nNote that the return type of a coroutine can have any name (I call it `Task`, so that it makes intuitive sense). Compiling the preceding code again gives us errors. All errors are about missing functions in the `promise_type`:\n\n```shell\n<source>: In function 'Task coro_func()':\n<source>:11:5: error: no member named 'return_void' in\n'std::__n4861::__coroutine_traits_impl<Task, void>::promise_type' {aka 'Task::promise_type'}\n   11 |     co_return;\n      |     ^~~~~~~~~\n<source>:10:6: error: no member named 'unhandled_exception' in\n'std::__n4861::__coroutine_traits_impl<Task, void>::promise_type' {aka 'Task::promise_type'}\n   10 | Task coro_func(){\n      |      ^~~~~~~~~\n<source>:10:6: error: no member named 'get_return_object' in\n'std::__n4861::__coroutine_traits_impl<Task, void>::promise_type' {aka 'Task::promise_type'}\n```\n\nOne of the important functions of the `promise_type` is that it determines what happens at certain key points in the coroutine's life. It determines, what happens at the startup and completion of execution of the coroutine. \n\n### Implementing the `promise_type`\n\nThe first thing that the compiler expects from us the `get_return_object()` function. The return type of this function is the same as the return type of the coroutine.\n\n```cpp\n#include <coroutine>\n#include <print>\n\nstruct Task{\n    struct promise_type{\n        Task get_return_object(){\n            std::println(\"get_return_object()\");\n            return Task{ *this };\n        }\n\n        void return_void() noexcept {\n            std::println(\"return_void()\");\n        }\n\n        void unhandled_exception() noexcept {\n            std::println(\"unhandled_exception()\");\n        }\n\n        std::suspend_always initial_suspend() noexcept{\n            std::println(\"initial_suspend()\");\n            return {};\n        }\n\n        std::suspend_always final_suspend() noexcept{\n            std::println(\"final_suspend()\");\n            return {};\n        }\n    };\n\n    explicit Task(promise_type&){\n        std::println(\"Task(promise_type&)\");\n    }\n\n    ~Task() noexcept{\n        std::println(\"~Task()\");\n    }\n};\n\nTask coro_func(){\n    co_return;\n}\n\nint main(){\n    coro_func();\n}\n```\n[Compiler Explorer](https://compiler-explorer.com/z/xoqanYjMT)\n\nOutput:\n```shell\nget_return_object()\nTask(promise_type&)\ninitial_suspend()\n~Task()\n```\n\nThe `get_return_object()` method is implicitly called when the coroutine starts executing. Its upto the `promise_type` to provide an implementation of this method that constructs the return object that will be handed back to the caller. The `Task` object is stored on the heap. You don't see this in the source code anywhere. When the coroutine reaches its first suspension point, and control flow is returned back to the caller, then the caller will receive this object.\n\nThe next thing we need to specify is the `return_void()` function. This is a customization point for handling what happens when we reach the `co_return` statement in the function body. There is also a corresponding `return_value()`, if you don't have an empty `co_return` statement, but we'll look at this at length later ahead.\n\nThe next one we need is `unhandled_exception()` and similar to the `return_void()`, this function is a customization point for handling, what happens when the coroutine throws an exception. We leave it empty for now.\n\nWe need to implement two more functions `initial_suspend()` and `final_suspend()`. These are basically the customization points that allow us to execute some code, both when the coroutine first starts executing and shortly before the coroutine ends execution. Here, we are returning `std::suspend_always` which basically means that at these points, I want to go into suspension.\nIn a typical implementation, you either return `std::suspend_always`, which means you pause execution at this point and hand control back to the caller always, or you return `std::suspend_never`, which basically means you just go on and continue executing the coroutine.\n\nNote that, `final_suspend()` is not printed in the output, because the coroutine is paused at `initial_suspend()` and since I never resumed it, I don't see the output on the console. \n\n## A yielding coroutine\n\nThe do-nothing coroutine was great to get a gut intuitive feel for the basic mechanics of writing low-level coroutines in C++. Let's implement another coroutine that can send data back to the caller.\n\nIn this second example, we implement a coroutine that produces a message. It will be the hello world of coroutines. The coroutine will say hello and the caller function will print the message received from the coroutine.\n\nTo implement this functionality, we need to establish a communication channel from the coroutine to the caller. This channel is the mechanism that allows the coroutine to pass values to the caller and receive information from it. This channel is established through the coroutine's `promise_type` and the *coroutine handle*.\n\nThe *coroutine handle* is a type that gives access to the coroutine frame(the coroutine's internal state) and allows the caller to resume or destroy the coroutine. The handle is what the caller can use to resume the coroutine after it has been suspended (for example after `co_await` or `co_yield`). The handle can also be used to check whether the coroutine is done or to clean up its resources.\n\nThe following code is the new version of both the caller function and the coroutine:\n\n```cpp\nTask coro_func(){\n    co_yield \"Hello world from the coroutine\";\n    co_return;\n}\n\nint main(){\n    auto task = coro_func();\n    std::print(\"task.get() = {}\", task.get());\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThe coroutine *yields* and sends some data to the caller. The caller reads that data and prints it. When the compiler reads the `co_ yield` expression, it will generate a call to the `yield_value` function defined in the `promise_type`. Thus, we add the following code to the `promise_type` :\n\n```cpp\nstruct Task{\n    struct promise_type{\n        std::string output_data;\n\n        /* ... */\n        std::suspend_always yield_value(std::string msg) noexcept{\n            output_data = std::move(msg);\n        }\n    };\n\n    explicit Task(promise_type&){\n        std::println(\"Task(promise_type&)\");\n    }\n\n    ~Task() noexcept{\n        std::println(\"~Task()\");\n    }\n};\n```\n\nThe function gets a `std::string` object and moves it to the `output_data` member variable of the promise type. But, this just keeps the data inside the `promise_type`. We still need a mechanism to get that data out of the coroutine.\n\n### The coroutine handle\n\nOnce we require a communication channel to and from a coroutine, we need a way to refer to a suspended or executing coroutine. The mechanism to refer to the coroutine object is through a pointer or handle called a **coroutine handle**. The C++ library header file `<coroutine>` defines a type `std::coroutine_handle` to work with coroutine handles. \n\nTwo functions are of interest to us in the `std::coroutine_handle` interface : `resume()` and `destroy()`. \n\n```cpp\nstruct coroutine_handle<promise_type>{\n    /* ... */\n    void resume() const;\n    void destroy() const;\n    promise_type& promise() const;\n    static coroutine_handle from_promise(promise_type&);\n}\n```\n\nWhat `resume()` does is simply, it resumes the suspended coroutine. It continues execution. \n\nIf we think of this coroutine frame or object living somewhere on the heap, where all of the state of execution is stored, one way to destroy this state is to let the coroutine run to completion. But, far more commonly, we would like to manage the lifetime externally and we can then just call the `destroy()` function which will then get rid of the coroutine state.\n\nNote that, the `coroutine_handle` is not a smart pointer type. So, you have to call the `destroy()` explicitly. \n\nThere's two more functions `.promise()` and `.from_promise()`. These are used to convert from a coroutine to a promise object and vice versa.\n\nWe add the following functionality to our return type to manage the coroutine handle:\n\n```cpp\nstruct Task{\n    struct promise_type{\n        std::string output_data;\n\n        /* ... */\n        std::suspend_always yield_value(std::string msg) noexcept{\n            output_data = std::move(msg);\n        }\n    };\n\n    // Coroutine handle member-variable\n    std::coroutine_handle<promise_type> handle{};\n\n    // ReturnType(promise_type&) ctor initializes \n    // the coroutine handle member variable\n    explicit Task(promise_type& promise)\n    : handle { std::coroutine_handle<promise_type>::from_promise(promise) }\n    {\n        std::println(\"Task(promise_type&)\");\n    }\n\n    // Destructor\n    ~Task() noexcept{\n        std::println(\"~Task()\");\n        if(handle)\n            handle.destroy();\n    }\n};\n```\nThe preceding code declares a coroutine handle of type `std::coroutine_handle<promise_type>` and creates the handle in the return type constructor. The handle is destroyed in the return type destructor. \n\nNow, back to our yielding coroutine. The only missing bit is a `get()` function for the caller to be able to extract the resultant string out of the promise.\n\n```cpp\nstd::string get(){\n    if(!handle.done()){\n        handle.resume();\n    }\n    return std::move(handle.promise().output_data);\n}\n```\n\nThe `get()` function resumes the coroutine if it has not terminated and return the result stored in the `output_data` member variable of the promise. The full source code listing is shown below:\n\n```cpp\n#include <coroutine>\n#include <print>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n\nusing namespace std::string_literals;\n\nstruct Task{\n    struct promise_type{\n        std::string output_data{};\n\n        Task get_return_object(){\n            std::println(\"get_return_object()\");\n            return Task{ *this };\n        }\n\n        void return_void() noexcept {\n            std::println(\"return_void()\");\n        }\n\n        void unhandled_exception() noexcept {\n            std::println(\"unhandled_exception()\");\n        }\n\n        std::suspend_always initial_suspend() noexcept{\n            std::println(\"initial_suspend()\");\n            return {};\n        }\n\n        std::suspend_always final_suspend() noexcept{\n            std::println(\"final_suspend()\");\n            return {};\n        }\n\n        std::suspend_always yield_value(std::string msg) noexcept{\n            std::println(\"yield_value(std::string)\");\n            output_data = std::move(msg);\n            return {};\n        }\n    };\n\n    // Coroutine handle member-variable\n    std::coroutine_handle<promise_type> handle{};\n\n    // ReturnType(promise_type&) ctor initializes \n    // the coroutine handle member variable\n    explicit Task(promise_type& promise)\n    : handle { std::coroutine_handle<promise_type>::from_promise(promise) }\n    {\n        std::println(\"Task(promise_type&)\");\n    }\n\n    ~Task() noexcept{\n        std::println(\"~Task()\");\n        if(handle)\n            handle.destroy();\n    }\n\n    std::string get(){\n        std::println(\"get()\");\n        if(!handle.done())\n            handle.resume();\n\n        return std::move(handle.promise().output_data);\n    }\n};\n\nTask coro_func(){\n    co_yield \"Hello world from the coroutine\";\n    co_return;\n}\n\nint main(){\n    auto task = coro_func();\n    std::cout << task.get() << std::endl;\n}\n```\n[Compiler Explorer](https://compiler-explorer.com/z/EjdWEnb5a)\n\nOutput:\n\n```shell\nget_return_object()\nTask(promise_type&)\ninitial_suspend()\nget()\nyield_value(std::string)\nHello world from the coroutine\n~Task()\n```\n\nThe output shows what is happening during the coroutine execution. The `Task` object is created after a call to `get_return_object`. The coroutine is initially suspended. The caller wants to get the message from the coroutine so `get()` is called, which resumes the coroutine. When the compiler sees `co_yield` statement in the coroutine, it generates an implicit called to `yield_value(std::string)`. `yield_value` is called and the message is copied to the resultant member variable `output_data` in the promise. Finally, the message is printed by the caller function, and the coroutine returns. \n\n## A waiting coroutine\n\nWe are now going to implement a coroutine that can wait for the input data sent by the caller. In our example, the coroutine will wait until it gets a `std::string` object and then print it. We say that the coroutine waits, we mean it is suspended (that is, not executed) until the data is received.\n\nWe start with changes to both the coroutine and the caller function:\n\n```cpp\nTask coro_func(){\n    std::cout << co_await std::string{};\n    co_return;\n}\n\nint main(){\n    auto task = coro_func();\n    task.put(\"To boldly go where no man has gone before\");\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn the preceding code, the caller function calls the `put()` function(a method in the return type structure) and the coroutine calls `co_await` to wait for a `std::string` object from the caller.\n\nThe changes to the return type are simple, that is, just adding the `put()` function.\n\n```cpp\nvoid put(std::string msg){\n    handle.promise().input_data = std::move(msg);\n    if(!handle.done()){\n        handle.resume();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWe need to add the `input_data` variable to the promise structure. But, just with those changes to our first example and the coroutine handle from the previous example, the code cannot be compiled.\n\n\n```cpp\n#include <print>\n#include <string>\n#include <coroutine>\n#include <iostream>\n\nstruct Task{\n    struct promise_type{\n        std::string input_data{};\n\n        Task get_return_object() noexcept{\n            std::println(\"get_return_object\");\n            return Task{ *this };\n        } \n\n        void return_void() noexcept{\n            std::println(\"return_void\");\n        }\n\n        std::suspend_always initial_suspend() noexcept{\n            std::println(\"initial_suspend\");\n            return {};\n        }\n\n        std::suspend_always final_suspend() noexcept{\n            std::println(\"final_suspend\");\n            return {};\n        }\n        void unhandled_exception() noexcept{\n            std::println(\"unhandled_exception\");\n        }\n\n        std::suspend_always yield_value(std::string msg) noexcept{\n            std::println(\"yield_value\");\n            //output_data = std::move(msg);\n            return {};\n        }\n    };\n\n    std::coroutine_handle<promise_type> handle{};\n\n    explicit Task(promise_type& promise)\n    : handle{ std::coroutine_handle<promise_type>::from_promise(promise)}\n    {\n        std::println(\"Task(promise_type&) ctor\");\n    }\n\n    ~Task() noexcept{\n        if(handle)\n            handle.destroy();\n\n        std::println(\"~Task()\");\n    }\n\n    void put(std::string msg){\n        handle.promise().input_data = std::move(msg);\n        if(!handle.done())\n            handle.resume();\n    }\n};\n\nTask coro_func(){\n    std::cout << co_await std::string{};\n    co_return;\n}\n\nint main(){\n    auto task = coro_func();\n    task.put(\"To boldly go where no man has gone before\");\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n[Compiler Explorer](https://compiler-explorer.com/z/1qafsj83e)\n\nThe compiler gives us the following error:\n\n```shell\n<source>: In function 'Task coro_func()':\n<source>:62:18: error: no member named 'await_ready' in 'std::string' {aka 'std::__cxx11::basic_string<char>'}\n   62 |     std::cout << co_await std::string{};\n      |                  ^~~~~~~~\n```\n\nLet's explore more about what this error message means.\n\n## What is an awaitable?\n\nAn *awaitable* is any object, I can call `co_await` on. You can think of `co_await` like an operator, and its argument as an *awaitable*. The way to think about the operator `co_await` is that these are opportunities for suspension. These are the points where the coroutine can be paused, and the control-flow can be handed back to the caller. The awaitable controls what happens at these points. Similar to, how the `promise_type` provides hooks to control what happens at startup or when you return from the coroutine, the awaitable provides these hooks for what happens when we go into suspension. They may decide not to suspend at all, and let the execution just continue. Not every `co_await` call necessary suspends. It's totally upto the coroutine-writer. Let's try to implement such an awaitable.\n\n```cpp\nstruct Awaitable{\n    bool await_ready();\n    void await_suspend(std::coroutine_handle<promise_type>);\n    void await_resume(std::coroutine_handle<promise_type>);\n};\n```\n\nThe first function is `.await_ready()` which returns a `bool`. This determines whether we do actually go into suspension or we just say, *yeah, we are ready, and we don't want to go into suspension*, we want to continue execution and in that case we just return `true`.\n\nThe next function is `.await_suspend()` and that is the customization point that will get executed shortly before the coroutine function goes to sleep. \n\nThe next function is `.await_resume()` and that is the customization point that will get execute just after the coroutine is resumed.\n\nThe following code shows our implementation of the `await_transform` function and the `Awaitable` struct:\n\n```cpp\nauto await_transform(std::string) noexcept{\n    struct Awaitable{\n        promise_type& promise;\n\n        bool await_ready() const noexcept{\n            return true;    // Says, yeah we are ready\n                            // we don't need to sleep. Just go on.\n        }\n\n        std::string await_resume() const noexcept{\n            return std::move(promise.input_data);\n        }\n\n        void await_suspend(std::coroutine_handle<promise_type>) const noexcept{}\n\n    };\n\n    return Awaitable(*this);\n}\n```\n\nThis is the code for the full example of the waiting coroutine:\n\n```cpp\n#include <print>\n#include <string>\n#include <coroutine>\n#include <iostream>\n\nstruct Task{\n    struct promise_type{\n        std::string input_data{};\n\n        Task get_return_object() noexcept{\n            std::println(\"get_return_object\");\n            return Task{ *this };\n        } \n\n        void return_void() noexcept{\n            std::println(\"return_void\");\n        }\n\n        std::suspend_always initial_suspend() noexcept{\n            std::println(\"initial_suspend\");\n            return {};\n        }\n\n        std::suspend_always final_suspend() noexcept{\n            std::println(\"final_suspend\");\n            return {};\n        }\n        void unhandled_exception() noexcept{\n            std::println(\"unhandled_exception\");\n        }\n\n        std::suspend_always yield_value(std::string msg) noexcept{\n            std::println(\"yield_value\");\n            //output_data = std::move(msg);\n            return {};\n        }\n\n        auto await_transform(std::string) noexcept{\n            struct Awaitable{\n                promise_type& promise;\n\n                bool await_ready() const noexcept{\n                    return true;    // Says, yeah we are ready\n                                    // we don't need to sleep.

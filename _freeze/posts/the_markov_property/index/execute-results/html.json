To see this, consider $(\\mathcal{F}_t,t\\geq 0)$, the natural filtration of the Brownian motion $(B_t,t\\geq 0)$. Consider $g(B_t)$ for some time $t$ and bounded function $g$. (For example, $g$ could be an indicator function.) Consider also a random variable $W$ that is $\\mathcal{F}_s$ measurable for $s < t$. (For example, $W$ could be $B_s$ or $1_{B_s > 0}$.) Let's compute $\\mathbb{E}[g(B_t)W]$.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{E}[g(B_t)W] &= \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[Wg(B_t - B_s + B_s)|\\mathcal{F}_s]]\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe random variable $(B_t - B_s)$ follows a $\\mathcal{N}(0,t-s)$ distribution. By LOTUS,\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{E}[g(B_t)W] \n&= \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\mathbb{E}[W g(y + B_s)|\\mathcal{F_s}]f_{(B_t - B_s)|B_s}(y) dy\\\\\n&= \\{\\text{ Using the fact that }B_t - B_s \\perp B_s\\}\\\\\n&= \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\mathbb{E}[W g(y + B_s)]f_{(B_t - B_s)}(y)dy\\\\\n&= \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\mathbb{E}[W g(y + B_s)]\\frac{e^{-\\frac{y^2}{2(t-s)}}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi(t-s)}}dy\n\\end{align*}\n\nBy Fubini's theorem, the integral and the expectation operator can be interchanged, and since $W$ is $\\mathcal{F}_s$ measurable, it follows from the definition of conditional expectations that:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{E}[g(B_t)|\\mathcal{F}_s] &= \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} g(y + B_s) \\frac{e^{-\\frac{y^2}{2(t-s)}}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi(t-s)}}dy\n\\end{align*}\n$$ {#eq-conditional-expectation-of-function-brownian-motion}\n\nWe make two important observations. First, the right hand side is a function of $s,t$ and $B_s$ only (and not of the Brownian motion before time s). In particular, we have:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[g(B_t)|\\mathcal{F}_s] = \\mathbb{E}[g(B_t)|B_s]\n$$\n\nThis holds for any bounded function $g$. In particular, it holds for all indicator functions. This implies that the conditional distribution of $B_t$ given $\\mathcal{F}_s$ depends solely on $B_s$, and not on other values before time $s$. Second, the right-hand side is *time-homogenous* in the sense that it depends on the time difference $t-s$. \n\nWe have just shown that Brownian motion is a *time-homogenous Markov process*. \n\n::: {#def-markov-process}\n\n### Markov process.\n\nConsider a stochastic process $(X_t,t\\geq 0)$ and its natural filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_t,t\\geq 0)$. It is said to be a *Markov process* if and only if for any (bounded) function $g: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[g(X_t) | \\mathcal{F}_s] = \\mathbb{E}[g(X_t) | X_s], \\quad \\forall t \\geq 0, \\forall s \\leq t\n$$ {#eq-markov-process}\n\n:::\n\nThis implies that $\\mathbb{E}[g(X_t)|\\mathcal{F}_s]$ is an explicit function of $s$, $t$ and $X_s$. It is said to be *time-homogenous*, if it is a function of $t-s$ and $X_s$. Since the above holds for all bounded $g$, the conditional distribution of $X_t$ given $\\mathcal{F}_s$ is the same as the conditional distribution of $X_t$ given $X_s$. \n\nOne way to compute the conditional distribution of $X_t$ given $\\mathcal{F}_s$ is to compute the conditional MGF given $\\mathcal{F}_s$, that is:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[e^{a X_t}|\\mathcal{F}_s], \\quad a \\geq 0\n$$ {#eq-conditional-mgf-of-xt}\n\nThe process would be Markov, if the conditional MGF is an explicit function of $s$, $t$ and $X_s$. \n\n::: {#exm-brownian-motion-is-markov}\n\n(Brownian Motion is Markov) Let $(B_t,t\\geq 0)$ be a standard brownian motion. Our claim is that the brownian motion is a markov process.\n:::\n\n*Proof.*\n\nWe have:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{E}[e^{a B_t}|\\mathcal{F}_s] &= \\mathbb{E}[e^{a (B_t - B_s + B_s)}|\\mathcal{F}_s]\\\\\n& \\{ \\text{ since }B_s \\text{ is }\\mathcal{F}_s-\\text{ measurable }\\}\\\\\n&= e^{a B_s} \\mathbb{E}[e^{a (B_t - B_s)}|\\mathcal{F}_s]\\\\\n& \\{ \\text{ since }B_t - B_s \\perp \\mathcal{F}_s \\}\\\\\n&= e^{a B_s} \\mathbb{E}[e^{a (B_t - B_s)}]\\\\\n&= e^{a B_s} e^{\\frac{1}{2}a^2(t-s)}\n\\end{align*}\n\nThis closes the proof. $\\blacksquare$\n\nAn equivalent (but more symmetric) way to express the Markov property is to say that *the future of the process is independent of the past, when conditioned on the present*. Concretely, this means that for any $r < s< t$, we have that $X_t$ is independent of $X_r$, when we condition on $X_s$.\n\nThe conditional distribution of $X_t$ given $X_s$ is well described using *transition probabilities*. We will more interested in a case well these probabilities admit a density $f_{X_t|X_s=x}(y)$. More precisely, for such a Markov process, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{E}[g(X_t)|X_s = x] &= \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} g(y) f_{X_t|X_s=x}(y) dy\\\\\n&=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} g(y) p(y,t|x,s) dy\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nHere, we explicitly write the left-hand side as a function of space, that is, the position $X_s$, by fixing $X_s = x$. In words, the *transition probability density* $p(y,t|x,s)$ represents the probability density that starting from $X_s = x$ at time $s$, the process ends up at $X_t = y$ at time $t > s$. If the process is time-homogenous, this only depends on the time difference $(t-s)$ and we write $p(y,t|x,s)$. From @eq-conditional-expectation-of-function-brownian-motion, we can write:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[g(B_t)|B_s = x] = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} g(u + x) \\frac{e^{-\\frac{u^2}{2(t-s)}}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi(t-s)}} du\n$$\n\nIn the above expression, the random variable $B_t - B_s$ takes some value $u \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $B_s = x$ is fixed. Then, $B_t$ takes the value $u + x$. Let $y = u + x$. Then, $u = y - x$. Consequently, we may write:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[g(B_t)|B_s = x] = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} g(y) \\frac{e^{-\\frac{(y-x)^2}{2(t-s)}}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi(t-s)}} dy\n$$\n\nSo, the transition density function for standard Brownian motion is:\n\n$$\np(y,t|x,0)= \\frac{e^{-\\frac{(y-x)^2}{2s}}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi s}}, \\quad s>0, x,y\\in\\mathbb{R}\n$$ {#eq-brownian-motion-transition-density-function}\n\nThis function is sometimes called the *heat kernel*, as it relates to the *heat equation*. \n\nThe Markov property is very convenient to compute quantities, as we shall see throughout the chapter. As a first example, we remark that it is easy to express joint probabilities of a markov process $(X_t,t\\geq 0)$ at different times. Consider the functions $f = \\mathbf{1}_A$ and $g = \\mathbf{1}_B$ from $\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, where $A$ and $B$ are two intervals in $\\mathbb{R}$. Let's compute $\\mathbb{P}(X_{t_1} \\in A, X_{t_2} \\in B) = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{1}_{A} \\mathbf{1}_{B}] = \\mathbb{E}[f(X_{t_1}) g(X_{t_2})]$ for $t_1 < t_2$. By the properties of conditional expectation and the Markov property, we have:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{P}(X_{t_1} \\in A, X_{t_2} \\in B) &= \\mathbb{E}[f(X_{t_1})g(X_{t_2})]\\\\\n&= \\mathbb{E}[f(X_{t_1})\\mathbb{E}[g(X_{t_2})|\\mathcal{F}_{t_1}]]\\\\\n&= \\mathbb{E}[f(X_{t_1})\\mathbb{E}[g(X_{t_2})|X_{t_1}]]\n\\end{align*}\n\nAssuming that the process is time-homogenous and admits a transition density $p(y,t|x,0)$ as for Brownian motion, this becomes:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{P}(X_{t_1} \\in A, X_{t_2} \\in B) &= \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x_1) \\left(\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} g(x_2) p(x_2,t_2|x_1,t_1) dx_2 \\right) p(x_1,t_1|x_0,0) dx_1\\\\\n&= \\int_{A} \\left(\\int_{B} p(x_2,t_2|x_1,t_1) dx_2 \\right) p(x_1,t_1|x_0,0) dx_1\n\\end{align*}\n\nThis easily generalizes to any finite-dimensional distribution of $(X_t, t\\geq 0)$.\n\n::: {#exm-markov-versus-martingale}\n\n(Markov versus Martingale.) Martingales are not markov processes in general and markov processes are not martingales in general. There are processes such as brownian motion that enjoy both. An example of a markov process that is not a martingale is a Brownian motion with a drift $(X_t, t \\geq 0)$, where $X_t = \\sigma B_t + \\mu t$. Conversely, take $Y_t = \\int_0^t X_s dB_s$, where $X_s = \\int_0^s B_u dB_u$. The integrand $X_s$ depends on whole Brownian motion path upto time $s$ and not just on $B_s$. \n:::\n\n::: {#nte-functions-of-markov .callout-tip}\n\n### Functions of Markov Processes\n\nIt might be tempting to think that if $(X_t,t\\geq 0)$ is a Markov process, then the process defined by $Y_t = f(X_t)$ for some reasonable function $f$ is also Markov. Indeed, one could hope to write for an arbitrary bounded function $g$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{E}[g(Y_t)|\\mathcal{F}_s] = \\mathbb{E}[g(f(X_t))|\\mathcal{F}_s] = \\mathbb{E}[g(f(X_t))|\\mathcal{X}_s] \n\\end{align*}\n$$ {#eq-functions-of-markov-process}\n\nby using the Markov property of $(X_t,t\\geq 0)$. The flaw in this reasoning is that the Markov property should hold for the natural fitration $(\\mathcal{F}_t^Y,t\\geq 0)$ of the process $(Y_t,t\\geq 0)$ and not the one of $(X_t,t\\geq 0)$, $(\\mathcal{F}_t^X,t\\geq 0)$. It might be that the filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_t^Y,t\\geq 0)$ has less information that $(\\mathcal{F}_t^X,t\\geq 0)$, especially, if the function $f$ is not one-to-one. For example, if $f(x)=x^2$, then $\\mathcal{F}_t^Y$ has less information than $\\mathcal{F}_t^X$ as we cannot recover the sign of $X_t$ knowing $Y_t$. In other words, the second equality may not hold. In some cases, a function of a Brownian motion might be Markov, even when $f$ is not one-to-one. \n:::\n\nIt turns out that diffusions such as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and the Brownian bridge are Markov processes.\n\n::: {#thm-diffusions-are-markov-processes}\n\n### Diffusions are Markov processes. \n\nLet $(B_t,t\\geq 0)$ be a standard Brownian motion. Let $\\mu : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\sigma: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be differentiable functions with bounded derivatives on $[0,T]$. Then, the diffusion with the SDE \n\n$$\ndX_t = \\mu(X_t) dt + \\sigma(X_t)dB_t, \\quad X_0 = x_0\n$$\n\ndefines a time-homogenous markov process on $[0,T]$. \n:::\n\nAn analogous statement holds for time-inhomogenous diffusions. The proof is generalization of the Markov property of Brownian motion. We take advantage of the independence of Brownian increments. \n\n*Proof.*\n\nBy the [existence and uniqueness theorem](https://quantinsights.github.io/posts/ito-processes-and-stochastic-diff-eqs/#existence-and-uniqueness-of-sdes), this stochastic initial value problem(SIVP) defines a unique continous adapted process $(X_t,t\\leq T)$. Let $(\\mathcal{F}_t^X,t\\geq 0)$ be the natural filtration of $(X_t,t\\leq T)$. For a fixed $t > 0$, consider the process $W_s = B_{t+s} - B_t, s \\geq 0$. Let $(\\mathcal{F}_t,t \\geq 0)$ be the natural filtration of $(B_t,t \\geq 0)$. It turns out that the process $(W_s,s \\geq 0)$ is a standard brownian motion independent of $\\mathcal{F}_t$ (@exr-shifted-brownian-motion). For $s \\geq 0$, we consider the SDE:\n\n$$\ndY_s = \\mu (Y_s) ds + \\sigma(Y_s) dW_s, \\quad Y_0 = X_t\n$$\n\nAgain by the [existence and uniqueness theorem](https://quantinsights.github.io/posts/ito-processes-and-stochastic-diff-eqs/#existence-and-uniqueness-of-sdes), there exists a unique solution to the SIVP that is adapted to the natural filtration of $W$. Note that, the shifted process $(X_{t+s},s\\geq 0)$ is *the* solution to this SIVP since:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nX_{t+s} &= X_{t} + \\int_{t}^{t+s}\\mu(X_u) du + \\int_{t}^{t+s}\\sigma(X_u) dB_u\n\\end{align*}\n\nPerform a change of variable $v = u - t$. Then, $dv = du$, $dB_u = B(u_2) - B(u_1)= B(t + v_2) - B(t + v_1) = W(v_2) - W(v_1) = dW_v$. So,\n\n\\begin{align*}\nX_{t+s} &= X_{t} + \\int_{0}^{s}\\mu(X_{t+v}) dv + \\int_{0}^{s}\\sigma(X_{t+v}) dW_v\n\\end{align*}\n\nLet $Y_v= X_{t+v}$, $Y_0 = X_t$. Then,\n\n\\begin{align*}\nY_s &= Y_0 + \\int_{0}^{s}\\mu(Y_v) dv + \\int_{0}^{s}\\sigma(Y_v) dW_v\n\\end{align*}\n\nThus, we conclude that for any interval $A$:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(X_{t+s} \\in A|\\mathcal{F}_t^X) = \\mathbb{P}(Y_s \\in A | \\mathcal{F}_t^X)\n$$\n\nBut, since $(Y_s,s \\geq 0)$ depends on $\\mathcal{F}_t^X$ only through $X_t$ (because $(W_s,s \\geq 0)$ is independent of $\\mathcal{F}_t$), we conclude that $\\mathbb{P}(X_{t+s} \\in A|\\mathcal{F}_t^X) = \\mathbb{P}(X_{t+s} \\in A|X_t)$, so $(X_t,t \\geq 0)$ is a time-homogenous markov process. $\\blacksquare$\n\n## The Strong Markov Property\n\nThe Doob's Optional Stopping theorem extended some properties of martingales to stopping times. The Markov property can also be extended to stopping times for certain processes. These processes are called *strong Markov processes*. \n\nWe know, that the sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_t$ represents the set of all observable events upto time $t$. What is the sigma-algebra of observable events at a random stopping time $\\tau$? \n\n::: {#def-sigma-algebra-of-the-past}\n\n### $\\sigma$-algebra of $\\tau$-past\n\nLet $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},\\{\\mathcal{F}_t\\}_{t\\geq 0},\\mathbb{P})$ be a filtered probability space. The sigma-algebra at the stopping time $\\tau$ is then:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau} = \\{A \\in \\mathcal{F}_\\infty : A \\cap \\{\\tau \\leq t\\} \\in \\mathcal{F}_t, \\forall t \\geq 0 \\}\n$$ {#eq-sigma-algebra-of-the-past}\n\n:::\n\nIn words, an event $A$ is in $\\mathcal{F}_\\tau$, if we can determine if $A$ and $\\{\\tau \\leq t\\}$ both occurred or not based on the information $\\mathcal{F}_t$ known at any arbitrary time $t$. You should be able to tell the value of the random variable $\\mathbf{1}_A \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\tau \\leq t\\}}$ given $\\mathcal{F}_t$ for any arbitrary time $t \\geq 0$.\n\nFor example, if $\\tau < \\infty$, the event $\\{B_\\tau > 0\\}$ is in $\\mathcal{F}_\\tau$. However, the event $\\{B_1 > 0\\}$ is not in $\\mathcal{F}_\\tau$ in general, since $A \\cap \\{\\tau \\leq t\\}$ is not in $\\mathcal{F}_t$ for $t < 1$. Roughly speaking, a random variable that is $\\mathcal{F}_\\tau$-measurable should be thought of as an explicit function of $X_\\tau$. With this new object, we are ready to define the *strong markov property*.\n\n::: {#def-strong-markov-property}\n\n### Strong Markov Property\n\nLet $(X_t,t\\geq 0)$ be a stochastic process and let $(\\mathcal{F}_t,t\\geq 0)$ be its natural filtration.

By construction $\\tau_n$ depends only on the process in the past. Consider the process $W_t = B_{t + \\tau_n} - B_{\\tau_n}, t \\geq 0$. We show it is a standard brownian motion independent of $\\tau_n$. This is feasible as we can decompose over the discrete values taken by $\\tau_n$. More, precisely, take $E \\in \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_n}$, and some generic event $\\{W_t \\in A\\}$ for the process $W$. Then, by decomposing over the values of $\\tau_n$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{P}(\\{W_t \\in A\\} \\cap E) &= \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\{W_t \\in A\\} \\cap E \\cap \\{\\tau_n = \\frac{k}{2^n}\\}\\right)\\\\\n&= \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\{(B_{t+k/2^n} - B_{k/2^n}) \\in A\\} \\cap E \\cap \\{\\tau_n = \\frac{k}{2^n}\\}\\right)\\\\\n&= \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\{(B_{t+k/2^n} - B_{k/2^n}) \\in A\\}\\right) \\times \\mathbb{P}\\left( E \\cap \\{\\tau_n = \\frac{k}{2^n}\\}\\right)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nsince $(B_{t+k/2^n} - B_{k/2^n})$ is independent of $\\mathcal{F}_{k/2^n}$ by @exr-shifted-brownian-motion and since $E \\cap \\{\\tau_n = \\frac{k}{2^n}\\} \\in \\mathcal{F}_{k/2^n}$ by definition of stopping time. But, given $\\{\\tau_n = k/2^n\\}$, the event $\\{(B_{t+k/2^n} - B_{k/2^n}) \\in A\\}$ is the same as $\\{B_t \\in A\\} = \\{W_t \\in A\\}$, since this process is now a standard brownian motion. Thus, $\\mathbb{P}\\{(B_{t+k/2^n} - B_{k/2^n}) \\in A\\} = \\mathbb{P}\\{B_t \\in A\\} = \\mathbb{P}\\{W_t \\in A\\}$, dropping the dependence on $k$.

The extension to $\\tau$ is done by using continuity of paths.

Moreover, this implies that $B_{t+\\tau} - B_\\tau$ is independent of $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_n}$ for all $n$. Again by (right-)continuity this extends to independence of $\\mathcal{F}_\\tau$. The limiting distribution of the process is obtained by looking at the finite dimensional distributions of the increments of $B_{t+\\tau_n} - B_{\\tau_n}$ for a finite number of $t$'s and taking the limit as above. $\\blacksquare$\n\nMost diffusions also enjoy the strong markov property, as long as the functions $\\sigma$ and $\\mu$ encoding the volatility and drift are nice enough.

It was only in 1905, that Albert Einstein could provide a satisfactory explanation of Brownian motion. He asserted that Brownian motion originates in the continual bombardment of the pollen grains by the molecules of the surrounding water. As a result of continual collisions, the particles themselves had the same kinetic energy as the water molecules. Thus, he showed that Brownian motion provided a solution (in a certain sense) to Fourier's famous heat equation\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(t,x) = \\kappa \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}(t,x)\n$$\n\n### Albert Einstein's proof of the existence of Brownian motion\n\nWe now summarize Einstein's original 1905 argument. Let's say that we are interested in the motion along the horizontal $x$-axis. Let's say we drop brownian particles in a liquid. Let $f(t,x)$ represent the number of particles per unit volume (density) at position $x$ at time $t$. So, the number of particles in a small interval $I=[x,x+dx]$ of width $dx$ will be $f(t,x)dx$. \n\nNow, as time progresses, the number of particles in this interval $I$ will change. The brownian particles will zig-zag upon bombardment by the molecules of the liquid. Some particles will move out of the interval $I$, while other particles will move in. \n\nLet's consider a timestep of length $\\tau$. Einstein's probabilistic approach was to model the distance travelled by the particles or displacement of the particles as a random variable $\\Delta$. To determine how many particles end up in the interval $I$, we start with the area to the right of the interval $I$.\n\nThe density of particles at $x+\\Delta$ is $f(t,x+\\Delta)$; the number of particles in a small interval of length $dx$ is $f(t,x+\\Delta)dx$. If we represent the probability density of the displacement by $\\phi(\\Delta)$, then the number of particles at $x+\\Delta$ that will move to $x$ will be $dx \\cdot f(t,x+\\Delta)\\phi(\\Delta)$. We can apply the same logic to the left hand side. The number of particles at $x - \\Delta$ that will move to $x$ will be $dx \\cdot f(t,x-\\Delta)\\phi(-\\Delta)$. Assume that $\\phi(\\Delta) = \\phi(-\\Delta)$.\n\nNow, if we integrate these movements across the real line, then we get the number of particles at $x$ at a short time later $t + \\tau$. \n\n$$\nf(t+ \\tau,x) dx = dx \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(t,x+\\Delta) \\phi(\\Delta) d\\Delta\n$$\n\nNow, we can get rid of $dx$.\n\n$$\nf(t+ \\tau,x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(t,x+\\Delta) \\phi(\\Delta) d\\Delta\n$$ {#eq-expression-for-density-at-later-time}\n\nThe Taylor's series expansion of $f(t+\\tau,x)$ centered at $t$ (holding $x$ constant) is:\n\n$$\nf(t + \\tau,x) = f(t,x) + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}\\tau + O(\\tau^2)\n$$\n\n\nThe Taylor's series expansion of $f(t,x+\\Delta)$ centered at $x$ (holding $t$ constant) is:\n\n$$\nf(t,x+\\Delta) = f(t,x) + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\Delta + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}\\Delta^2 + O(\\Delta^3)\n$$\n\nWe can now substitute these into @eq-expression-for-density-at-later-time to get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nf(t,x) + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}\\tau &= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\left(f(t,x) + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\Delta + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}\\Delta^2\\right) \\phi(\\Delta)d\\Delta\\\\\n&= f(t,x) \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\phi(\\Delta)d\\Delta \\\\\n&+ \\frac{\\partial f} {\\partial x} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\Delta \\phi(\\Delta)d\\Delta \\\\\n&+ \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\Delta^2 \\phi(\\Delta)d\\Delta\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNow, since the probability distribution of displacement $\\phi(\\cdot)$ is symmetric around the origin, the second term is zero. And we know, that if we integrate the density over $\\mathbb{R}$, we should get one, so the first term equals one. So, we get:\n\n$$\nf(t,x) + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}\\tau = f(t,x) + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\Delta^2 \\phi(\\Delta)d\\Delta\n$$\n\nNow, we can cancel the $f$ on both sides and then shift $\\tau$ to the right hand side:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} =  \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\tau} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\Delta^2 \\phi(\\Delta)d\\Delta \\right)\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\n\nDefine $D:= \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\tau} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\Delta^2 \\phi(\\Delta)d\\Delta \\right)$. Then, we have: \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} =  D\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\n\nThe microscopic interpretation of the diffusion coefficient is, that its just the average of the squared displacements. The larger the $D$, the faster the brownian particles move.\n\n## Kolmogorov's Backward Equation\n\nThink of $y$ and $t$ as being current values and $y'$ and $t'$ being future values. The transition probability density function $p(y',t'|y,t)$ of a diffusion satisfies two equations - one involving derivatives with respect to a future state and time ($y'$ and $t'$) called *forward equation* and the other involving derivatives with respect to the current state and current time ($y$ and $t$) called the *backward equation*. These two equations are parabolic partial differential equations not dissimilar to the Black-Scholes equation. \n\n::: {#thm-backward-equation-with-initial-value}\n\n### Backward equation with initial value\n\nLet $(X_t,t\\geq 0)$ be a diffusion in $\\mathbb{R}$ with the SDE:\n\n$$\ndX_t = \\sigma(X_t)dB_t + \\mu(X_t) dt\n$$\n\nLet $g\\in C^2(\\mathbb{R})$ be such that $g$ is $0$ outside an interval.

As advertised earlier, the forward equation is satisfied by the transition $p_t(y',t'|y,t)$ of a diffusion. Before showing this in general, we verify it in the Brownian case.\n\n::: {#exm-the-heat-kernel-as-the-solution-of-the-forward-equation}\nRecall that the transition probability density $p(y,t|x,0)$ for Brownian motion, or heat kernel, is:\n\n$$\np(y,t|x,0) = \\frac{e^{-\\frac{(y-x)^2}{2}}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}}\n$$\n\nHere, the space variable will be $y$ and $x$ will be fixed.

In some sense, the adjoint operator plays a role similar to that of the transpose of a matrix in linear algebra. The adjoint acts on the function on the left. To see this, consider two functions $f,g$ of space on which the generator $A$ of a diffusion is well-defined. In particular, let's assume that the functions are zero outside an interval. Consider the quantity \n\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}g(x)A(f(x))dx = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} g(x)\\left(\\frac{\\sigma(x)^2 }{2}f''(x) + \\mu(x)f'(x)\\right)dx\n$$\n\nThis quantity can represent for example the average of $Af(x)$ over some PDF $g(x)$. In the above, $A$ acts on the function on the right. To make the operator act on $g$, we integrate by parts. This gives for the second term:\n\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} g(x)\\mu(x)f'(x)dx = g(x)\\mu(x)f(x)\\Bigg|_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}-\\int_{\\mathbb{R}}f(x)\\frac{d}{dx}(g(x)\\mu(x))dx\n$$\n\nThe boundary term $g(x)f(x)\\mu(x)\\Bigg|_{-\\infty}^\\infty$ is $0$ by the assumptions on $f,g$.

How robust is this representation? In other words, is it possible to slightly change the PDE and still get a stochastic representation representation for the solution? The answer to this question is yes, when a term of the form $r(x)f(t,x)$ is added to the equation, where $r(x)$ is a well-behaved function of space (for example, piecewise continuous). The stochastic representation of the PDE in this case bears the name *Feynman-Kac* formula, making a fruitful collaboration between the physicist [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) and the mathematician [Mark Kac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kac). By the way, you pronounce \"Kac\" as \"cats\". His name is Polish. People who immigrated from Poland before him spelled their names as \"Katz\".

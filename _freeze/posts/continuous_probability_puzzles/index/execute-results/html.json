It is maximized if the masses are placed far away from the center of gravity. So, if we place two point masses with probability weights $1/2$ at $(-1,0)$ and $(1,0)$, the variance would be maximal. Hence, the maximum variance equals $1$. \n\n::: {#exm-puzzle-2}\n\nWhat is the maximum possible variance of a random variable that takes the values in the set $[0,1]$?\n\n:::\n\n*Solution*.\n\nAgain, we can have point masses with probability weights $1/2$ at $X=0$ and $X=1$. The center of mass or expectation of this distribution $EX = 1/2$. So, the maximal variance would be $(1/2)(1/2)^2 + (1/2)(1/2)^2=1/4$.\n\n\n::: {#exm-puzzle-3}\n\nLet $X$ be a random variable such that $P(X > 0)$. Suppose that for some real numbers $a$ and $b$ \n\n:::\n\n*Solution*.\n\nAgain, we can have point masses with probability weights $1/2$ at $X=0$ and $X=1$.

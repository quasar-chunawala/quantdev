It is maximized if the masses are placed far away from the center of gravity. So, if we place two point masses with probability weights $1/2$ at $(-1,0)$ and $(1,0)$, the variance would be maximal. Hence, the maximum variance equals $1$. \n\n::: {#exm-puzzle-2}\n\nWhat is the maximum possible variance of a random variable that takes the values in the set $[0,1]$?\n\n:::\n\n*Solution*.\n\nAgain, we can have point masses with probability weights $1/2$ at $X=0$ and $X=1$. The center of mass or expectation of this distribution $EX = 1/2$. So, the maximal variance would be $(1/2)(1/2)^2 + (1/2)(1/2)^2=1/4$.\n\n\n::: {#exm-puzzle-3}\n\nLet $X$ be a random variable such that $P(X \\ne 0) > 0$. Suppose that for some real numbers $a$ and $b$, the random variables $aX$ and $bX$ have the same distribution. Is it true that $a = b$? What if we also assume that $a$ and $b$ are both positive.\n\n:::\n\n*Solution*.\n\nIf $aX$ and $bX$ have the same mass distribution, they have the same expectation and variance.\n\nHence, $\\mathbb{E}[aX] = \\mathbb{E}[bX]$. So, $a\\mathbb{E}[X] = b \\mathbb{E}[X]$. Consequently, $(a-b)\\mathbb{E}[X] = 0$. If $a \\neq b$, then $\\mathbb{E}[X] = 0$. For example, consider the $U \\sim U[-1,1]$ random variable. Both $U$ and $-U$ have the same distribution. Also, their second moments must match. So, $\\mathbb{E}[aX$\n\n",

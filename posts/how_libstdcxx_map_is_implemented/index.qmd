We all love maps. A map is simply a data-structure that allows you to associate a key with some kind of value. They are fast and help to solve a large number of problems. Have you wondered what the internal implementation of a map looks like? In this post, I am going to explore the implementation details of unordered associative containers from the standard library(GCC's `libstdc++` implementation).

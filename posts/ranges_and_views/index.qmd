# C++ Ranges

## What is a range?

A **range** is a programmatic abstraction for a sequence of elements, bounded by two iterators(one to the first element of the sequence and one to the last element). 

Containers such as `std::vector`, `std::list` and `std::map` are concrete implementations of the range abstraction. The standard algorithms are generic. They are container agnostic. They know nothing about `std::vector`, `std::map` or `std::list`. They handle range abstractions with the help of a pair of iterators.  However, this has a shortcoming: we always need a `begin()` and `end()` iterator from a container. Here are some examples:

```cpp
// sort a vector
std::vector v{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
std::sort(v.begin(), v.end());

// count the even numbers of an array
std::array<int, 5>a{1, 5, 3, 2, 4};
auto even_count = std::count_if(
    a.begin(),
    a.end(),
    [](int const n){ return n % 2 == 0; }
);
```

There are few cases when we only need to process a part of the container's elements. In the vast majority of the cases, we need to write `v.begin()` and `v.end()` over and over again. Ideally, we would prefer to shorten all this and be able to write the following:

```cpp
// sort a vector
std::vector v{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
std::sort(v.begin(), v.end());

// count the even numbers of an array
std::array<int, 5>a{1, 5, 3, 2, 4};
auto even_count = std::count_if(
    a.begin(),
    a.end(),
    [](int const n){ return n % 2 == 0; }
);
```

On the other hand, we often need to compose multiple operations together. Most of the time that involves many operations and code that is too verbose even when using standard algorithms. Consider the following example: given a sequence of integers, we want to print to the console the square of all even numbers, except the first two, in descending order of their value (not their position in the sequence). There are multiple ways to solve this problem. Here is one possible solution:

```cpp
std::vector<int> v{1, 5, 3, 2, 8, 7, 6, 4};

// copy only the even elements
std::vector<int> temp;
std::copy_if(v.begin(), v.end(), std::back_inserter(temp), [](int n){
    return n % 2 == 0;
});

// sort the elements
std::sort(temp.begin(), temp.end(), [](int a, int b){ return a > b; });

// remove the first two
temp.erase(temp.begin() + temp.size() - 2, temp.end());

// transform the elements
std::transform(temp.begin(), temp.end(), [](int const n){ return n*n; });

// print each element
std::for_each(temp.begin(), temp.end(), [](int n){ std::println("{}, n"); });
```

While anyone familiar with standard algorithms can read this code, there are several downsides. Its a lot of code to write and also requires a temporary container  with repetitive calls to `begin()` and `end()`. All of the computation is done eagerly, so the  intermediate results of each step are held in memory.

Most people would easily understand the following version of the previous code and also prefer to write it as such:

```cpp
std::vector<int> v{1, 5, 3, 2, 8, 7, 6, 4};

using std::ranges = stdr;
using std::ranges::views = stdv;

stdr::sort(v);

auto r = v  | filter([](int n) { return n % 2 == 0; })
            | drop(2)
            | reverse
            | transform([](int n){ return n*n; });
```

This is what the C++20 standard provides with the help of the ranges library. This has two main components:

- **Range algorithms**, which enable us to operate on concrete ranges (standard containers or ranges) and not on abstract ranges delimited by a pair of iterators
- **Views or range adapters**, which represent non-owning iterable sequences. They enable us to compose operations more easily such as in the last example.

## Understanding range concepts and views

The term *range* refers to an abstraction that defines a sequence of elements bounded by start and end iterators. A range, therefore, represents an iterable sequence of elements. However, such a sequence can be defined in several ways:

- With a `begin` iterator and an `end` sentinel. Such a sequence is iterated from beginning to the end. A **sentinel** is an object that indicates the end of the sequence. It can have the same type as the iuterator type or it can be of a differnt type.
- With a start object and a size(number of elements), representing a so-called counted sequence. Such a sequence is iterated $N$ times (where $N represents the size) from the start. 
- With a start and a predicate, representing a so-called conditionally termninated sequence. Such a sequence is iterated from the start until the predicate returns false.
- With only a start value, representing a so-called unbounded sequence. Such a sequence can be iterated indefinitely. 

All these kinds of iterable sequences are considered ranges. Because a range is an abstraction, the C++20 library defines a series a of concepts to describe the requirements for range types. These are available in the `<ranges>` header and the `std::ranges` namespace. The following table presents a list of range concepts:

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `range` | Defines the requires for a type `R` to be a range by provdiding a begin iterator and an end sentinel. The iterator and the sentinel can be of different types. |
| `borrowed_range` | Defines the requirements for a type `R` so that a function can take an object of this type by value and return iterators obtained from this object without the danger of dangling. |
| `sized_range` | Defines the requirements for a type `R` to be a range that knows its size in constant time. |
| `common_range` | Defines the requirements for a type `R` to be a range whose iterator and sentinel types are equal. |
| `view` | Defines the requirements of type `R` that is a range to have constant-time, copy, move and assignment opertions. |
| `viewable_range` | Defines the requirements for a range type `R` to be convertible to a view. |

Other range concepts such as `input_range`, `output_range`, `forward_range`, `bidirectional_range`, `random_access_range`, `contiguous_range` are modeled after the corresponding iterator concepts.

A **view** is a lightweight object that applies the transformation only when a new element is requested(iterated) and not hen the view is created. Its key feature is **lazy evaluation**. It is like a stream. So, views are lightweight objects, with non-owning semantics. They don't own the underlying data.

There is a series of views provided with C++20 and new views have also been included in C++23. Views are available by including the `<ranges>` header under the `std::ranges` namespace, for example, `std::ranges::iota_view`. 

The `iota` view is part of a special category of views called **factories**. These factories are views over newly generated ranges. The following factories are available in the ranges library:

| Type | Variable | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `ranges::empty_view` | `ranges::views::empty` | Generates a view with no elements of `T` type |
| `ranges::single_view` | `ranges::views::single` | Generates a view with a single element of a `T` type |
| `ranges::iota_view` | `ranges::views::iota` | Generates a view of a sequence of consecutive elements, from a start value to an end value (a bounded view) or indefinitely (an unbounded view) |
| `ranges::basic_iostream_view` | `ranges::views::istream` | Generates a view of the sequence of elements by applying the operator `>>` repeatedly |

Here is a quick example for using `iota`:

```cpp
// using iota_view
using stdr = std::ranges;
using stdv = std::views;

for(auto i : stdr::iota_view(1,10))
    std::print("{}, ", i);

// using stdv::iota
for(auto i : stdv::iota(1,10))
    std::print("{}, ", i);
```

If you are wondering why `empty_view` and `single_view` are useful, the answer should not be hard to find. These are useful in template code that handles ranges where empty ranges or ranges with one element are valid inputs. you don't want multiple overloads of a function template for handling these special cases; instead, you can pass an `empty_view` or `single_view` range. The following snippets show several examples of using these factories. 

```cpp
```

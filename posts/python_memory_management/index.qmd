# Introduction 

CPython is one of the many implementations of the Python runtime written in human-readable Python and C code. There are other implementations such as PyPy, Jython. In this blog post, I summarize how object memory is alllocated and freed and how CPython manages memory leaks.

Python is a dynamically-typed language. The size of variables can't be calculated at compile-time. Most of Python's core types are dynamically sized. The `list` type can be of any size, a `dict` can have any number of keys, and even `int` is dynamic. The user never has to specify the size of these types. Names in Python can be reused for values of different types.

```{python}
a_value = 1
a_value = "Now, I'm a string"
a_value = ["Now", "I", "am", "a", "list"]
```

To overcome these constraints, CPython relies heavily on dynamic memory allocation, but adds safety rails to automate the freeing of memory using the garbage collection and reference counting algorithms.

Instead of the Python developer having to allocate memory, Python object memory is allocated automatically by a single, unified API. This design requires that the entire CPython standard library and core modules(written in C) use this API.

# Allocation Domains

- The raw domain is used for allocation from the system heap and large, or non-object related memory.

- The object domain is used for the allocation of all Python object related memory.

- The PyMem domain is the same as `PYMEM_DOMAIN_OBJ`. this exists for legacy purposes.

Each domain implements the same interface of frunctions:

- `_Alloc(size_t size)` allocates memory of `size` bytes and returns a pointer.

- `_Calloc(size_t nelem, size_t el_size)` allocates `nelem` elements each of size `el_size` and returns a pointer.

- `_Realloc(void* ptr, size_t new_size)` reallocates memory of size `new_size`.

- `_Free(void* ptr)` frees memory at `ptr` back to the heap.

The `PyMemAllocatorDomain` enumeration represents the three domains in CPython as `PYMEM_DOMAIN_RAW`, `PYMEM_DOMAIN_OBJ` and `PYMEM_DOMAIN_MEM`.

CPython uses $2$ memory allocators:

- `malloc` is the operating system allocator for the raw memory domain.
- `pymalloc` is the CPython allocator the PyMem and object domains.

# The CPython memory allocator

The CPython memory alloctor sit on top of the OS memory allocator and has an algorithm for allocation. 

- Most of the memory allocation requests are small and of a fixed size, because `PyObject` is $16$ bytes, `PyASCIIObject` is $42$ bytes, `PyCompactUnicodeObject` is $72$ bytes.

- The `pymalloc` allocator allocates memory blocks only upto $256$ KB. Anything larger is sent to the OS allocator.

- `pymalloc` uses the GIL instead of the system thread-safety check.

To help clarify this situation, you can imagine a sports stadium, home of CPython FC, as an analogy. To help manage crowds, CPython FC has implemented a system breaking the stadium up into sections A to E, each with seating in rows $1$ to $40$. 

At the front of the stadium, rows $1$ to $10$ are the roomier premium seats, with $80$ seats in each row. At the back rows $31$ to $40$ are the conomy seats with $150$ seats per row.

The Python memory allocation algorithm has similar characteristics:

- Just like the stadium as seats, the `pymalloc` algorithm has memory blocks.
- Just like the seats can be premium, regular, or economy, memory blocks are all of range of fixed sizes. You can't bring your desk chair!
- Just like seats of the same size are put into rows, blocks of the same size are put into pools.

# CPython interning

The general rule is that objects are allocated on assignment. Variables just point to objects. There is an exception to this general rule. This is python runtime implementation specific. Often commonly used objects are preallocated and are shared instead of costly new allocations. This is mainly done for performance optimization. 

```{python}
x = 255
y = 255
print(x is y, x == y)
x = 1024
y = 1024
print(x is y, x == y)
```

`int`s in the range $[-5,257)$, empty tuples and all empty or single length strings are preallocated. 

## `string` interning explained

String interning is a method of storing only one copy of each distinct string value, which must be immutable. In Python3, we have a function `sys.intern()` and if we use this function, we can enter a string in the table of interned strings. We get a reference to the interned string. 

So, we can gain a little extra performance on dictionary lookup (key comparisons after hashing can be done by a pointer compare instead of a string compare). 

Names used in programs are automatically interned. Dictionaries used to hold module, class or instance attributes have interned keys. 

```{python}
from sys import intern
a, b = "strin", "string"
print(f"{a + 'g' is b}")    # Returns false
intern(a + 'g') is intern(b) # returns True
```

# Mutable containers memory allocationn strategy

There are different mutable containers in Python - `list`s, `set`s and `dict`s. Behind the scenes, there is a strategy for allocating these containers. 

A good strategy will plan for growth and shrinkage. It will slightly overallocate memory needed by the container, to leave room for growth. Each time we append to a `list`, we won't have to reallocate the memory. We also have to remember that sometimes we have to shrink the memory for a mutable container. This can help reduce the number of expensive function calls for instance to `realloc` or `memcpy`.

# List allocation strategy

Lists are stored as fixed length array of pointers. So, we just point to objects. By design, we overallocate for list growth by append.

- The capacity growth pattern is roughly $4,8,16,25,35,46,\ldots$
- 

If we put something at the end of the list, these operations are cheap. But, if we put something in the middle or the beginning, we'll have to copy/shift the elements in memory to perform this operation. 

On my 64-bit machine, with Python 3.13.7, the list allocation size is:

- 64 bits : `56 + 8 * length`

```{python}
import sys
l = []
for i in range(17):
    l.append(i+1)
    print(f"List len = {len(l)}, size = {sys.getsizeof(l)} bytes")
```

There is a fixed overhead of $56$ bytes (the object header, type pointer, reference count ) etc.

For each size tier, the calculation is approximately:

- 88 bytes = 56 + 32(4 slots)
- 120 bytes = 56 + 64(8 slots)
- 184 bytes = 56 + 128(16 slots)
- 248 bytes =56 + 192(24 slots)

We shrink when the list size goes below $1/2$ of the allocated storage. This is why appending to Python lists is $O(1)$ amortized time - most appends just fill unused capacity, and only occasional appends trigger a reallocation. 

# Overallocation of dictionaries and sets

These are represented as fixed-length hash tables. We overallocate when we reach $2/3$rd of the capacity of a dictionary of set. For small dictionaries or sets, we quadruple the capacity else we double the capacity.

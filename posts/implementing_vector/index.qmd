# Writing your own `dev::vector<T>` training implementation

In this blog post, we will write a naive `vector<T>` training implementation. Coding up these training implementations, handling corner cases, getting your code reviewed, revisiting your design is very effective at understanding the inner workings of STL data-strucures and writing good C++ code. I adopt a gradual refinement approach, so my first versions will be simpler but less efficient.

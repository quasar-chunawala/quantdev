## Interpolatory Quadrature Rules

### Introduction

We are interested in an approximate calculation of the definite integral

$$
\begin{align*}
I[f] = \int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx 
\end{align*}
$$ {#eq-definite-integral}

where $f(x)$ is a given function and $[a,b]$ is a finite interval. This problem is often called **numerical quadrature**, since it relates to the ancient problem of the quadrature of a circle i.e. constructing a square with equal area to that of a circle. The computation of the above quantity is equivalent to solving the IVP:

$$
\begin{align*}
y'(x) = f(x), \quad y(a)=0, \quad x \in[a,b]
\end{align*}
$$ {#eq-IVP}

for $y(b)=I[f]$.

As is well known, even many relatively simple integrals cannot be expressed in finite terms of elementary functions, and thus must be evaluated by numerical methods. Even when a closed form analytical solution exists, it may be preferable to use a numerical quadrature formula.

Since $I[f]$ is a linear functional, numerical integration is a special case of the problem of approximating a linear functional. We shall consider formulas of the form:

$$
\begin{align*}
I[f] \approx \sum_{i=1}^n w_if(x_i)
\end{align*}
$$ {#eq-quadrature-rules}

where $x_1 < x_2 < \ldots < x_n$ are distinct **nodes** and $w_1$, $w_2$, $\ldots$, $w_n$ the **corresponding weights**. Often (but not always) all nodes lie in $[a,b]$.

### Order of accuracy of a Quadrature Rule

A quadrature rule (@eq-quadrature-rules) has **order of accuracy** (or degree of exactness) equal to $d$, iff it is exact for all polynomials of degree $\leq d$, that is, for all $p\in\mathcal{P}_{d+1}$.

### Some Classical Formulas

Interpolatory quadrature formulas, where the nodes are constrained to be equally spaced, are called **Newton-Cotes** formulas. These are especially suited for integrating a tabulated function, a task that was more common before the computer age. The midpoint, the trapezoidal and the Simpson's rules, to be described here, are all special cases of (unweighted) Newton-Cotes formulas.

The **trapezoidal** rule is based on the linear interpolation of $f(x)$ at $x_1 = a$ and $x_2 = b$, that is, $f(x)$ is approximated by :

$$
\begin{align*}
p(x) = f(a) + (x-a)[a,b]f = f(a) + (x - a)\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}
\end{align*}
$$ 

The integral of $p(x)$ equals the area of a trapezoid with base $(b-a)$ times the average height $\frac{1}{2}(f(a) + f(b))$. Hence, 

$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx \approx \frac{(b-a)}{2}(f(a) + f(b))
$$

To increase the accuracy, we subdivide the interval $[a,b]$ and assume that $f_i = f(x_i)$ is known on a grid of equidistant points:

$$
\begin{align*}
x_0 = a, \quad x_i = x_0 + ih, \quad x_n = b
\end{align*}
$$ {#eq-grid-points}

where $h = (b - a)/n$ is the **step length**. The trapezoidal approximation for the $i$th subinterval is:

$$
\begin{align*}
\int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}} f(x)dx = T(h) + R_i, \quad T(h) = \frac{h}{2}(f_i + f_{i+1})
\end{align*}
$$ {#eq-trapezoidal-approx-in-ith-subinterval}

Let $p_2(x)\in\mathcal{P}_2$ be the unique interpolating polynomial (Newton polynomial) passing through the points $(x_i,f_i)$ and $(x_{i+1},f_{i+1})$, that is, $p_2(x_i)=f(x_i)$ and $p_2(x_{i+1}) = f(x_{i+1})$. The exact remainder in Newton's interpolation formula is given by:

$$
\begin{align*}
f(x) - p_2(x) &= [x_i,x_{i+1},x]f\cdot \Phi_2(x)\\
&=[x_i,x_{i+1},x]f \cdot (x - x_{i+1})\Phi_1(x)\\
&=[x_i,x_{i+1},x]f \cdot (x - x_{i+1})(x - x_{i})\Phi_0\\
&=[x_i,x_{i+1},x]f \cdot (x - x_{i+1})(x - x_{i})
\end{align*}
$$

So, we have:

$$
\begin{align*}
R_i &= \int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}} (f(x) - p_2(x))dx = \int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}}(x - x_i)(x - x_{i+1})[x_i,x_{i+1},x]f dx 
\end{align*}
$$ {#eq-remainder-term}


By the theorem on the remainder term for interpolation, we can write:

$$
[x_1,\ldots,x_n,x_{n+1}]f = \frac{f^{(n)}(\xi)}{n!}
$$

Consequently,

$$
[x_i,x_{i+1},x]f = \frac{f''(\xi)}{2}
$$

So, we have:

$$
\begin{align*}
R_i &= \frac{f''(\xi)}{2}\int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}} (x - x_i)(x - x_{i+1})dx 
\end{align*}
$$ {#eq-remainder-term-2}

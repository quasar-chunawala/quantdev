# IRS, Caps, Floors and Swaptions

## Fundamentals

I review here a few basic definitions relevant to the interest-rate world. 

:::{#def-zero-coupon-bond}

### Zero-coupon bond. 

A $T$-maturity zero-coupon bond (pure discount bond) is a contract that guarantees its holder the payment of $1\$$ at time $T$, with no intermediate payments. The contract value at time $t < T$ is denoted by $P(t,T)$. Clearly, $P(T,T) = 1$ $\forall T\in[0,\infty)$.

:::{#def-continuously-compounded-spot-interest-rate}

### Continuously-compounded spot interest rate.

The continuously-compounded spot interest rate prevailing at time $t$ for the maturity $T$ is denoted by $R(t,T)$ and is the constant rate at which an investment of $P(t,T)$ units of currency at time $t$ accrues continuously to yield a unit amount of currency at maturity $T$.

$$
\begin{align*}
R(t,T) := - \frac{\ln P(t,T)}{\tau(t,T)}
\end{align*}
$${#eq-continuously-compounded-spot-interest-rate}

The continuously-compounded interest rate is therefore a constant rate that is consistent with the zero-coupon-bond prices such that:

$$
\begin{align*}
e^{R(t,T)\tau(t,T)}P(t,T) = 1
\end{align*}
$${#eq-zero-coupon-bond-price-equation-1}

from which we can express the bond price in terms of the continuously compounded rate $R$:

$$
\begin{align*}
P(t,T) = e^{-R(t,T)\tau(t,T)}
\end{align*}
$${#eq-zero-coupon-bond-price-equation-2}
:::

:::{#def-simply-compounded-spot-interest-rate}

### Simply-compounded spot interest rate.
The simply-compounded spot interest rate prevailing at time $t$ for the maturity $T$ is denoted $L(t,T)$ and is the constant rate at which an investment has to be made to produce an amount of one unit of currency at maturity, starting from $P(t,T)$ units of currency at time $t$, when accruing occurs proportionally to the investment time. 

$$
\begin{align*}
P(t,T)(1 + L(t,T)\tau(t,T)) = 1
\end{align*}
$${#eq-simply-compounded-spot-interest-rate}

So, the bond price can be expressed in terms of $L$ as:

$$
\begin{align*}
P(t,T) = \frac{1}{1 + L(t,T)\tau(t,T)}
\end{align*}
$${#eq-bond-price-in-terms-of-a-simply-compounded-spot-rate}
:::

:::{#def-annually-compounded-spot-interest-rate}

### Annually-compounded spot interest rate.

The annually-compounded spot interest rate prevailing at time $t$ for the maturity $T$ is denoted by $Y(t,T)$ and is the constant (annualized) rate at which an investment has to be made to produce an amount of one unit of currency at maturity, starting from $P(t,T)$ units of currency at time $t$, reinvesting the obtained amounts once a year. We have:

$$
P(t,T)(1+Y(t,T))^{\tau(t,T)} = 1
$${#eq-annually-compounded-spot-interest-rate}
:::

Equivalently,

$$
Y(t,T) = \left[\frac{1}{P(t,T)}\right]^{\frac{1}{\tau(t,T)}} - 1
$${#eq-annually-compounded-spot-interest-rate-as-func-of-bond-price}

:::{#def-zero-coupon-curve}

### Zero-coupon curve.
The zero-coupon curve(sometimes also referred to as the *yield curve*) at time $t$ is the graph of the function

$$
T \mapsto \begin{cases} 
L(t,T) & t < T \leq t + 1 \text{ years }\\
Y(t,T) & T \geq t + 1\text{ years }
\end{cases}
$${#eq-zero-coupon-curve}
:::

:::{#def-discounting-curve}

### Discounting Curve.
The discounting curve at time $t$ is the plot of the function:

$$
T \mapsto P(t,T), \quad T > t
$${#eq-discounting-curve}

Such a curve is also referred to as the term structure of discount factors.
:::

:::{#def-simply-compounded-forward-rate}

### Simply-compounded forward interest rate.

The simply compounded forward interest rate prevailing at time $t$ for the expiry $T > t$, maturity $S > T$ and is defined by:

$$
\begin{align*}
F(t;T,S) := \frac{1}{\tau(T,S)}\left(\frac{P(t,T)}{P(t,S)} - 1\right)
\end{align*}
$${#eq-simply-compounded-forward-interest-rate}
:::

:::{#def-instantaneous-forward-rate}

### Instantaneous forward rate. 

The instantaneous forward interest rate prevailing at time $t$ for the maturity $T > t$ is denoted by $f(t,T)$ and is defined by:

$$
\begin{align*}
f(t,T) &= \lim_{S \to T^+} F(t;T,S) \\
&= \lim_{S \to T^+} \frac{1}{\tau(T,S)}\frac{P(t,T) - P(t,S)}{P(t,T)} \\
&= -\frac{1}{P(t,T)}\lim_{S \to T^+} \frac{P(t,S) - P(t,T)}{\tau(T,S)}\\
&= -\frac{1}{P(t,T)}\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{P(t,T+h) - P(t,T)}{h}\\
&= -\frac{1}{P(t,T)} \frac{\partial}{T}(P(t,T))\\
&= - \frac{\partial}{\partial T}(\ln P(t,T))
\end{align*}
$${#eq-instantaneous-forward-rate}

so we also have:

$$
P(t,T) = \exp\left(-\int_{t}^T f(t,u)du\right)
$${#eq-discount-curve-and-instantaneous-forward-rate}

## Classical LIBOR Rate Model

Let's start with the classical LIBOR rate model. Suppose that bank B enters into a contract at time $t$ with bank A, to borrow 1 EUR at time $T_0$ and return 1 EUR plus the interest cost at time $T_1$. What's the fair interest rate, that bank A and bank B can agree on? The MTM value to bank A is:

$$
\begin{align*}
V(t) &= P(t,T_0) \mathbb{E}^{T_0}[-1|\mathcal{F}_t] + P(t,T_1)\mathbb{E}^{T_1}[1+\tau K|\mathcal{F}_t]\\
0 &= -P(t,T_0) + P(t,T_1)(1+\tau K)
\end{align*}
$$

where $\tau=\tau(T_0,T_1)$ is the day-count fraction between $[T_0,T_1]$ 

## Spot LIBOR Rate

The fair rate for an interbank lending deal with trade date $t$, starting date $T_0$ (typically 0d or 2d after $T$) and maturity date $T_1$ is:

$$
\begin{align*}
L(t;T_0,T_1) = \frac{1}{\tau}\left[\frac{P(t,T_0)}{P(t,T_1) - 1}\right]
\end{align*}
$$

Panel banks submit daily estimates for interbank lending rates to the calculation agent. The relevant periods $[T_0,T_1]$ considered are $1m$, $3m$, $6m$ and $12m$. LIBOR rate fixings used to be the most important reference rates for interest rate derivatives. Nowadays, overnight rates have become the key reference rates.

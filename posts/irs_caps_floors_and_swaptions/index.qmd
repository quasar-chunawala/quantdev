# Classical LIBOR Rate Model

Let's start with the classical LIBOR rate model. Suppose that bank B enters into a contract at time $t$ with bank A, to borrow 1 EUR at time $T_0$ and return 1 EUR plus the interest cost at time $T_1$. What's the fair interest rate, that bank A and bank B can agree on? The MTM value to bank A is:

$$
\begin{align*}
V(t) &= P(t,T_0) \mathbb{E}^{T_0}[-1|\mathcal{F}_t] + P(t,T_1)\mathbb{E}^{T_1}[1+\tau K|\mathcal{F}_t]\\
0 &= -P(t,T_0) + P(t,T_1)(1+\tau K)
\end{align*}
$$

where $\tau=\tau(T_0,T_1)$ is the day-count fraction between $[T_0,T_1]$ 

## Spot LIBOR Rate

The fair rate for an interbank lending deal with trade date $t$, starting date $T_0$ (typically 0d or 2d after $T$) and maturity date $T_1$ is:

$$
\begin{align*}
L(t;T_0,T_1) = \frac{1}{\tau}\left[\frac{P(t,T_0)}{P(t,T_1) - 1}\right]
\end{align*}
$$

Panel banks submit daily estimates for interbank lending rates to the calculation agent. The relevant periods $[T_0,T_1]$ considered are $1m$, $3m$, $6m$ and $12m$. LIBOR rate fixings used to be the most important reference rates for interest rate derivatives. Nowadays, overnight rates have become the key reference rates.

## Value Categories

In C++, every expression is either an *lvalue* or an *rvalue*. 

An *lvalue* denotes an object whose resources cannot be reused. The object is an *lvalue*, if you can't take the guts(resources) out of this object and donate it to someone else. *lvalue*s include expressions that designate objects by their name. For example, in the expression `double y = f(x)`, `y` is an *lvalue*. Moreover, *lvalue*s have persistent storage and an identifiable memory address. For instance, if I declare `std::vector<double> v{1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0};`, then `v[0]` is an *lvalue*.

An *rvalue* denotes an object whose resources can be reused. The object is an *rvalue*, if you can take the guts(resources) out of it and donate it to another object. *rvalue*s typically include temporary objects as they can't manipulated at the place they are created and are likely to be destroyed soon. For instance, if declare `int x = 5;`, `5` is an *rvalue*. Moreover, in the statement `double y = f(x);`, the expression `f(x)` is an *rvalue*. 

C++ defines the following value categories:

- *lvalues*: expressions for locations of long-living objects or functions. These objects have identity, persist in memory and are addressable.
- *prvalues*: expressions for short-living values for initializations. *prvalues* themselves do not exist somewhere in memory, they do not denote objects. They are an abstract recipee for initializing an object of type `T`. 
- *xvalue*: A special location, representing a (long-living) object, whose resources/values are no longer needed. The guts of this object can be stolen. 

## Copy elison

Copy-elison is based on the fact that the compiler is allowed to follow the [as-if](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/as_if) rule. The compiler is allowed to generate any code which has the same effect as the code you told it to add. The standard actually says, that if the compiler is told to copy something, but the copy is not really necessary, because the original is not going to be used again, then the compiler is allowed to elide(omit) the copy. The compiler is allowed to elide copies, where the results are *as-if* copies were made.

Consider the function below:

```cpp

#include <cmath>
double discountFactor(double r, double t){
    double result = exp(-r * t);
    return result;
}

int main()
{
    double df {discountFactor(0.05, 1.00)};
    return 0;
}
```

How many parameters are passed to the function `discountFactor(double, double)`? C++ programmers answer $2$, assembly-language programmers answer $3$. Why? At a low-level, when we have a return-value, we have to tell the generated code, where to put the return value. The function is passed the address where the results should be written.

Alright, so this is what's going on. Our function `main()` is going to call `discountFactor(double, double)` in order to populate a local `df`. The stack frame for the function `main()` looks like this:

![Stack frame for main()](move_semantics_08.png)

Now, we are going to call the function `discountFactor(double, double)`. When we call `discountFactor(double, double)`, we have to create the stack-frame for `discountFactor(double, double)`.

![Call to discountFactor()](move_semantics_09.png)

Okay, now we execute the function `discountFactor(double, double)` and now the return value is now stored directly at the address given by `&df`. 

![Return statement](move_semantics_10.png)

So, this is going to elide the copy. This form of copy elison is called *Return Value Optimization*(RVO). The calling function allocates space for the return value on the stack, and passes the address of that memory to the callee. The callee can then construct a return value directly into that space, which eliminates the need to copy from the inside to the outside.

Also, although the compiler is normally required to make a copy when a function parameter is passed by value (so modifications to the parameter inside the function can’t affect the caller), it is allowed to elide the copy, when the source is a temporary.

```cpp
void f(std::string a)
{
    int b{123};
    //some code
    return;
}

void g()
{
    f(std::string("A"));
    std::vector<int> y;
}
```

This is how it actually works. We are going to create our temporary - the string `"A"` in the place, where we would have actually copied it, that is, in the local variable `a` in the stack frame of `f(std::string)`. 


## Moving data

As seen earlier, C++ sometimes performs unnecessary copying. 

```cpp
Vector<double> x;
x = Vector<double>({
        1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 
        6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0
    });
```

[cppinsights](https://cppinsights.io/s/230e7f56) produces the following annotations:

```
Vector<double> x = Vector<double>();
const double __temporary179_5[10] = {
    1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 
    6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0
};
const Vector<double> __temporary179_6 = Vector<double>(Vector<double>(std::initializer_list<double>{__temporary179_5, 10}));
x.operator=(__temporary179_6);
__temporary179_6.~Vector();
/* __temporary179_5 // lifetime ends here */
```

In the above code snippet, the temporary vector of reals $\{1.0,2.0,3.0,\ldots,10.0\}$ is copied element-wise to `x` and then destroyed immediately after. We've wasted a lot of energy in deep-copying. 

Similarly, appending to a full vector causes much copying before the append. That is not what we want to do.

What we really want to do is, transfer the contents of `__temporary19_6` vector to `x` in a very simple way. Firstly, we copy the pointers; we cannot stop there, because at this point there are two `Vector<T>` objects owning the same memory resource. 

![Step 1. Copy the pointers](move_semantics_11.png)

The second step is, of course to set the pointers of the temporary vector to `nullptr`. 

![Step 2. Zero out the members of __temp](move_semantics_12.png)

That looks great and this is cheap! We are doing the minimum amount of work to transfer the contents of the temporary into `x`.

At the end of the assignment operation, the temporary goes out of scope and the vector $\{1,2,3,\ldots,10\}$ is in `x`. How do we implement this logic programmatically?

In addition to the copy-constructor, we write a move constructor. A move constuctor simply moves the data by taking ownership of the pointer that refers to the data, leaving the data itself where it resides.

```cpp
// move constructor
Vector(Vector&& src) noexcept
{
    // Just swap the memory pointers
    std::swap(src, *this);
}
```

### *rvalue* references in detail

The constructor takes an argument of the type *rvalue* reference. *rvalue* references are declared two ampersands. *lvalue*s bind to *lvalue* references. When taking a reference to a temporary object, an *rvalue*, you have two choices. *rvalue*s can bind to:

- A `const` *lvalue* reference.
- A mutable *rvalue* reference. 

```cpp
const std::string& r1 {"hello"};    
std::string& r2 {"world"};

const Vector<int>& r3 {1,2,3,4,5};
Vector<int>&& r4{6,7,8,9,10};
```

All these references have the semantics of - *we can steal/modify the resources of the object we refer to, provided the state of the object remains a valid state*. Technically, these semantics are not checked by compilers, so we can modify an *rvalue* reference as we can do with any non-`const` object of the type. We might also decide not to  modify the value.

```cpp
std::string&& r1 = "hello";    
r1 += "world"; 

Vector<int>&& r2 {1,2,3,4,5};
r2.push_back(6);
```

And it's a logic error to take a mutable *lvalue* reference to a temporary, so this is disallowed in the language:

```cpp
// std::string& r1 = "hello";    //error: this is not possible
// r1 += "world"; 
// Vector<int>& r2 {1,2,3,4,5};
// r2.push_back(6);
```

Assigning a temporary to a reference extends the lifetime of the temporary so that it matches the lifetime of the reference. So, this is legal:

```cpp
int main()
{
    {
        const std::string& s = foo();
        std::cout << s << std::endl;    //the temporary to which s refers is still alive
    }
    //but now it's destroyed
    return 0;    
}

```

And so is this:

```cpp
std::string foo(){ return "foo";};      //function that returns a string

void bar(std::string&& s){              // extends the lifetime as before
    std::cout << s; 
}    

int main()
{
    bar(foo());     
    return 0;
}
```

### *rvalue* references as parameters

When we declare a parameter to be an *rvalue* reference, it has exactly the behavior and semantics as introduced above:

- The parameter can only bind to a temporary object or an *rvalue*.
- According to the semantics of *rvalue* references:
  - The caller claims that it is no longer interested in the object. Therefore, you can steal the guts of object, take ownership of its resources.
  - However, the caller might still be interested in using the object. Therefore, any modification should keep the referenced object in a valid state.

## `std::move()`

Hey, this is cool! Why don't we apply these ideas to the below example?

```cpp
Vector<int> v1 {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
Vector<int> v2 {v1};
```

Well, in this case, we would have a problem. `v1` has a name, it has a persistent storage location and a memory address, it is an *lvalue*. You can't steal the contents of `v1`.  

But, we can do something about this. If indeed you are interested to transfer the contents of `v1` into `v2`, then all we need to do is use `std::move`. 

```cpp
Vector<int> v1 {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
Vector<int> v2 {std::move(v1)};
```

`std::move()` is a function that you can think of as performing an unconditional cast of its argument to an *rvalue* reference. `std::move(v1)` marks `v1` to be movable. It does not physically move anything. It signals, that the object `v1` may be *moved from*.  

If you have an *lvalue*, an object for which the lifetime does not end when you use it, you can mark it with `std::move()` to express *I no longer need this object here*. `std::move` does not move; it only sets a temporary marker in the context where the expression is used:

```cpp
void foo1(const std::string& lr);    //binds to the passed object without modifying it
void foo1(std::string&& rv);         //binds to the passed object and might steal/modify its contents

std::string s{"hello"};

foo1(s);                             //calls the first foo(), s keeps its value
foo1(std::move(s));                  //calls the second foo(), s might lose its value
                                     //semantically s no longer legal to access
```

Objects marked with `std::move()` can still be passed to a function that takes an ordinary `const` *lvalue* reference. Consider another code snippet:

```cpp
void foo2(const std::string& lr);   //binds to the passed object without modifying it
                                    //no other overload of foo2()
foo2(s);                            // calls foo2(), s keeps its value
foos(std::move(s))                  // calls foo2(), s keeps its value because we know that
                                    // foo2() can't modify or take ownership of the contents of s.
```

Semantically, `s` is still legal to access after the execution of the last line. Because there's overload of `foo2(const std::string&&)`, there is no ways its contents can be modified or transferred. 

Note that, an object marked with `std::move()` cannot be passed to a non-`const` *lvalue* reference.

### Header file for `std::move()`

`std::move()` is defined as a function in the C++ standard library. To use it, you have to include the header file `<utility>` where it is defined:

### Implementation of `std::move()`

`std::move()` is nothing but a `static_cast` to an *rvalue* reference. You can achieve the same effect by calling `static_cast` manually as follows:

```cpp
foo(static_cast<decltype(obj)&&>(obj));     //same effect foo(std::move(obj))
```

Therefore, we could also write:

```cpp
std::string s{"hello"};
foo(static_cast<std::string&&>(s));
```

## Moved-from objects

After a `std::move()`, moved-from objects are not (partially) destroyed. They are still valid objects for which at least the destructor will be called. However, they should also be valid in the sense that they have a consistent state and all operations work as expected. The only thing you do not know is their contents. 

### Valid but unspecified state

The C++ standard library guarantees that moved-from objects are in a *valid but unspecified state*. Consider the following code:

```cpp
std::string s{"hello"};
std::vector<std::string> coll{};
coll.push_back(std::move(s));
```

After passing `s` with `std::move()` you can ask for the number of characters, print out the value, or even assign a new value. However, you cannot print the first character or any other character without checking the number of characters first:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <utility>

int main()
{
    std::string s{"hello"};
    std::vector<std::string> coll{};
    coll.push_back(std::move(s));   //keeps in a valid but unclear state
    std::cout << "Contents of s : " << s << "\n";     //ok (don't know which value is written)
    std::cout << "size : " << s.size() << "\n"; //ok (rites the number of characters)
    // std::cout << "[0] = " << s[0] << "\n"; //error (potentially undefined behavior)
    s = "new value";    // ok
    return 0;
}
```
[Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/z/MY4Y576n1)

stdout
```
Contents of s : 
size : 0
```

### Reusing moved-from objects

We might wonder why moved-from objects are still valid objects and are not (partially) destroyed. The reason is that there are useful applications of move semantics, where it makes sense to use moved-from objects again.

For example, consider code where we read chunks of data from a network socket or read strings line-by-line from a file stream and move them into a vector:

```cpp
std::vector<std::string> allRows;
std::string row;

while(std::getline(myStream, row)){ //read next line into row
    allRows.push_back(std::move(row));  //and move it to somewhere
}
```

Each time after we read a line into `row`, we use `std::move()` to move the value of `row` into the vector of all rows. Then, `std::getline()` uses the moved-from object `row` again to read the next line into it.

As a second example, consider a generic function that swaps two values:

```cpp
template <typename T>
void swap(T& a, T& b)
{
    T tmp{std::move(a)};
    a = std::move(b);       //assign new value to moved-from a
    b = std::move(temp);    //assign new value to moved-from b
}
```

Here, we move the value of `a` into a temporary object to be able t move-assign the value of `b` afterwards. The moved-from object `b` then receives the value of `tmp`, which is the former value of `a`. 

Code like this is used in sorting algorithms for example, sorting a vector of buy/sell orders in the order book by the bid/ask prices. 

### Move assignments of objects to themselves

The rule that moved-from objects are in a *valid but unspecified state* usually also applies to objects after a direct or indirect self-move.

For example, after the following statement, the object `x` is usually valid without its value being known:

```cpp
x = std::move(x);   //afterwards x is valid but has an unclear value
```

## The canonical move constructor and move assignment operator

Consider the below `Widget` class as an example. The canonical move constructor and move assignment operators are written as follows:

```cpp
class Widget{
    private:
        int i;
        std::string s{};
        int* resource;            // Owning pointer

    public:
    // Move constructor
    Widget(Widget&& rhs) noexcept //Phase 1: member-wise swap
        : i {std::move(rhs.i)}
        , s {std::move(rhs.s)}
        , resource{std::move(rhs.resource)}
    {
        rhs.resource = nullptr; // Phase 2: reset the move-from object
    }

    // Move assignment operator
    Widget& operator=(Widget&& src)
    {
        delete resource;            //Phase 1: Cleanup
        std::swap(src, *this);      //Phase 2: Member-wise move
        src->resource = nullptr;    //Phase 3: Reset
        return *this;
    }

    Widget::Widget& operator=(Widget src);
}
```

An owning-pointer such `int*` is special, and it has to be dealt with separately. 

Raw pointers are bad (especially owning raw pointers). In this case, the declaration doesn't indicate whether it points to an element or an array. 

If instead, we have a smart-pointer, then what I can do is omit is phase 2. 

```cpp
class Widget{
    private:
        int i;
        std::string s{};
        int* resource;      

    public:
    // Move constructor
    Widget(Widget&& rhs) noexcept //Phase 1: member-wise swap
        : i {std::move(rhs.i)}
        , s {std::move(rhs.s)}
        , resource{std::move(rhs.resource)}
    {}

    // Move assignment operator
    Widget& operator=(Widget&& src)
    {
        std::swap(src, *this); 
        return *this;
    }

    Widget::Widget& operator=(Widget src);
}
```

I would like to show you one more thing. The canonical copy assignment operator also doubles up as a move-assignment operator. 

```cpp
// Copy/Move assignment operator
Widget::Widget& operator=(Widget src)  //Copy/move constructor called 
{
    std::swap(src, *this); 
    return *this;
}

int main()
{
    Widget w1(5,"hello", new int(10)),
    Widget w2 = w1;     //copy/move assignment operator called
    Widget w3 = std::move(w1);  //copy/move assignment operator called
}

```

In the assignment statement `Widget w2 = w1;`, first the copy constructor is called and the contents of `w1` are copied to `src`, before the control enters the body of `operator=(Widget)`. Whereas the assignment statement `Widget w3 = std::move(w1)` results in the invocation of the move constructor and the contents of `w1` are transferred to `w3` before we execute the body of the assignment operator.

## Avoiding unnecessary `std::move()`

As we saw, returning a local object by value automatically uses move semantics if supported. However, to be safe, programmers might try to force this with an explicit `std::move()`:

```cpp
std::string foo()
{
    std::string s;
    // do something
    // ...
    return std::move(s);    //Bad, don't do this
}
```

Remember that `std::move()` is just a `static_cast` to an *rvalue* reference. Therefore, `std::move` is an expression that yields the type `std::string&&`. However, this no longer matches the return type and therefore disables *return value optimization*, which usually allows the returned object to be used as a return value. For types where move semantics is not implemented, this might even force the copying of the return value instead of just using the returned object as the return value.

## Value categories in detail

To compile an expression or statement it does not only matter whether the involved types fit. For example, you cannot assign an `int` to an `int`, when on the left hand side of the assignment, an `int` literal is used.

```cpp
int i{};
i = 88;     //Ok
//88 = i;   //Error
```

For this reason, each expression in C++ has a value category. Besides the type, the value category is essential to decide what you can do with an expression.

### Value categories since C++11

![Value Categories](move_semantics_14.png)

We have the following primary categories:

- *lvalue* (Locator Value)
- *prvalue* (Pure Readable Value)
- *xvalue* (Expiring Value)

The composite categories are:
- *glvalue* (generalized *lvalue*) as a common term for *lvalue* or *xvalue*
- *rvalue* as a common term for *xvalue* or *prvalue* 

Intuitively, it's easy to understand the primary value categories, if you look at the following diagram:

![Value Categories](move_semantics_15.png)

For example,

```cpp
class X{
};

X v;
const X c;

f(v);   //passes a modifiable lvalue
f(c);   //passes a non-modifiable lvalue
f(X()); //passes a prvalue (old syntax of creating a temporary)
f(X{}); //passes a prvalue (new syntax of creating a temporary)
f(std::move(v));  //passes an xvalue
```

Roughly speaking, as a rule of thumb:

- All names used as expressions are *lvalues*.
- All string literals used as expressions are *lvalues*. 
- All non-string literals used as expressions are *prvalues*.
- All temporaries without a name (especially objects returned by value) are *prvalues*. 
- All objects marked with a `std::move` are *xvalues*.

### Copy Elison since C++17

C++17 added mandates to the standard, formally known as :

- Guaranteed copy elison
- Guraranteed return value optimization
- Copy evasion

If, in an initialization of an object, when the initializer expression is *prvalue* of the same class type as the variable type, copy elison is guaranteed.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class T{
    public:
    T(){ std::cout << "c'tor T()\n";}
    T(const T& t){ std::cout << "c'tor T(const T& t)\n";}
    T(T&& t){ std::cout << "c'tor T(T&& t)\n";}
};
```

```cpp
T x{T{}};
```
In C++17, this is equivalent to `T x{};`. The default constructor is invoked only once.

Similarly, if, in a `return` statement the operand is a *prvalue* of the same class type as the function return type, copy elison is guaranteed.

```cpp
T func()
{
    return T{};
}

T x{func()}; //Only one default construction of T allowed here
```

Under the rules of C++17, under the hood, a *prvalue* will be used only as *unmaterialized* recipe of an object, until actual materialization is required. 

A *prvalue* is an expression whose evaluation *initializes/materializes* an object. This is called as *temporary materialization conversion*.

```cpp
class  T{
    public:
    T(){
        std::cout << "c'tor T()\n";
    }
    //delete move and copy constructors
    T(const T& other) = delete;
    T(T&& other) = delete;
}

T make(){
    //Creates the first temporary (pre C++17)
    return T{};
}

int main(){
    // Construct the second temporary (pre C++17)
    // Copy/move temporary into N using the = operator (pre C++17)
    T t = make();
    return 0;
}
```

Pre C++17, the function `make()` would construct a temporary within its scope. This temporary would then be copied/moved into another temporary within the `main` scope. Finally, the `operator=` would build `t` via copy/move construction. All of this temporary business would be elided by (RVO) by any decent compiler resulting in `make()` constructing a single object within `t`. However, this elison is somewhat optional, so the compiler must also demand that copy and move constructors exist, just in case. The above code does not compile with any pre C++17 compiler.

Post C++17, `make()` creates an object of type `T` within `t`. Avoiding excessive use of temporary objects is now a language feature and the reliance on compiler optimization is removed. The above code does compiler with a post C++17 compiler. 

### Value Categories since C++17

C++17 has the same value categories but clarified the semantic meaning of the value categories as described in the figure above.

The key approach for explaining value categories now is that in general, we have two major kinds of expressions:




## Perfect Forwarding

### Motivation for perfect forwarding

Consider a function that declares the parameter as *rvalue* reference:

```cpp
void f(std::string&& s)
{
    // Do something
    std::cout << "string s : " << s << "\n";
}
```

As we've learned, we can only pass *rvalue*s to this function:

```cpp
std::string s{"hello"};
// f(s);                // Error : passing an lvalue to an rvalue ref
f(std::move(s));        // okay, passing an xvalue
f(std::string("world"));// okay, passing a prvalue
```

However, when we use the parameter `s` inside the function `f(std::string&&)`, we are dealing with an object that has a name. This means that we use `s` as an *lvalue*. We can do only what we are allowed to do with an *lvalue*. This means that we cannot call our function recursively. 

```cpp
void f(std::string&& s)
{
    // Do something
    std::cout << "string s : " << s << "\n";
    // f(s);    // Error: passing an lvalue to an rvalue reference
}
```

We have to mark `s` with `std::move()` again:

```cpp
void f(std::string&& s)
{
    // Do something
    std::cout << "string s : " << s << "\n";
    f(std::move(s));    // Ok, passing an xvalue
}
```

This is the formal specification of the rule that **move semantics is not passed through**. 

To forward an object that is passed with move semantics to a function, it not only has to be bound to an *rvalue* reference; you have to use `std::move()` again to forward its move semantics to another function. 

For example:

```cpp
class X{
    // ...
};

//forward declarations
void foo(const X&);     //for constant values (read-only access)
void foo(X&);           //for variable values (out parameters)
void foo(X&&);          //for values that are no longer used(move semantics)
```

We have the following rules when calling these functions:

```cpp
X v;
const X c;

foo(v);     //calls foo(X&)
foo(c);     //calls foo(const X&)
foo(X{});   //calls foo(X&&)
foo(std::move(v))   //calls foo(X&&)
foo(std::move(c))   //calls foo(const X&)
```

Now, assume that we want to call `foo()` for the same arguments indirectly via a helper function `callFoo()`. That helper function would also need the three overloads.

```cpp
void callFoo(const X& arg){     //arg binds to all const objects
    foo(arg);                   //calls foo(const X&)
}

void callFoo(X& arg)            //arg binds to lvalues
{
    foo(arg);                   //calls foo(&)
}

void callFoo(X&& arg){          //arg binds to rvalues
    foo(std::move(arg));        //needs std::move() to call foo(X&&)
}
```

In all cases, `arg` is used as an *lvalue* (being an object with a name). The first version forwards it as a `const` object, but the other two cases implement two different ways to forward the non-`const` argument. 

- Arguments declared as *lvalue* references (that bind to objects that do not have move semantics) are passed as they are.
- Arguments declared as *rvalue* references (that bind to objects that have move semantics) are passed with `std::move`. 

This allows us to forward move semantics perfectly: for any argument that is passed with move semantics, we keep the move semantics; but we do not add move semantics when we get an argument that does not have it. 

Only with this implementation is the use of `callFoo` to call `foo` transparent.

```cpp
X v;
const X c;

callFoo(v);     //calls foo(X&)
callFoo(c);     //calls foo(const X&)
callFoo(X{});   //calls foo(X&&)
callFoo(std::move(v))   //calls foo(X&&)
callFoo(std::move(c))   //calls foo(const X&)
```

Remember that an *rvalue* passed to an *rvalue* reference becomes an *lvalue* when used, which means that we need `std::move()` to pass it as an *rvalue* again. However, we cannot use `std::move()` everywhere. For the other overloads, using `std::move()` would call the overload of `foo()` for *rvalue* references when an *lvalue* is passed. 

For *perfect forwarding* in generic code, we would always need all these overloads for each parameter. To support all combinations, this means having $3^2 = 9$ overloads for $2$ generic arguments and $3^3 = 27$ overloads for $3$ generic arguments.

Therefore, C++11 introduced a special way to *perfectly forward* without any overloads but still keeping the type and the value category.

### Implementing perfect forwarding

To avoid overloading functions for parameters with different value categories, C++ introduced the mechanism of perfect forwarding. You need three things:

1. Take the call parameter as a pure *rvalue* reference (delcared with `&&` but without `const` or `volatile`)
2. The type of the parameter has to be a template parameter of the function. 
3. When forwarding the parameter to another function, use a helper function called `std::forward<>()` which is declared in `<utility>`.

You have to implement a function that perfectly forwards an argument as follows:

```cpp
template<typename T>
void callFoo(T&& arg)
{
    foo(std::forward<T>(arg));
}
```

`std::forward<>()` is defined as a conditional `std::move()`, so that we get the same behavior as the three (or four) overloads of `callFoo()` above:

- If we pass an *rvalue* to `arg`, we have the same effect as calling `foo(std::move(arg))`.
- If we pass an *lvalue* to `arg`, we have the same effect as calling `foo(arg)`. 

What exactly is happening here, is pretty tricky and needs a careful explanation.

### Universal and Forwarding references

First note that we declare `arg` as an *rvalue* reference parameter:

```cpp
template<typename T>
void callFoo(T&& arg)
```

This might give the impression that the rules of *rvalue* references apply. However, that is not the case. An *rvalue* reference (not qualified with `const` or `volatile`) of a *function template parameter* does not follow the rules of ordinary *rvalue* references. It is a different thing. 

#### Two terms : Universal and Forwarding Reference

Such a reference is called a **universal reference**. Unfortunately, there is also another term for it that is mainly used in the C++ standard: *forwarding reference*. There is no difference between these two terms, it is just that we have a historical mess here with two established terms that mean the same thing. Both terms describe basic aspects of universal/forwarding references:

- They can universally bind to objects of all types(`const` and non-`const`) and value categories.
- They are usually used to forward arguments; but note that this is not the only use (one reason for me to prefer the term *universal reference*)

#### Universal references bind to all value categories

The important feature of universal references is that they can bind to objects and expressions of any value category:

```cpp
template<typename T>
void callFoo(T&& arg);  //arg is universal/forwarding reference

X v;
const X c;
callFoo(v);             //ok
callFoo(c);             //ok
callFoo(X{});           //ok
callFoo(std::move(v));  //ok
callFoo(std::move(c));  //ok
```

In addition, they preserve the `const`-ness and value category (whether we have an *rvalue* or an *lvalue*) of the object they are bound to:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <type_traits>
class Widget{};

template <typename T>
void f(T&& arg){
    std::cout << std::boolalpha;

    if (std::is_same<T&&, Widget&>::value)
    {
        std::cout << "T&& = Widget&\n";
    }
    else if (std::is_same<T&&, const Widget&>::value)
    {
        std::cout << "T&& = const Widget&\n";
    }
    else if(std::is_same<T&&, Widget&&>::value)
    {
        std::cout << "T&& = Widget&&\n";
    }
    else if(std::is_same<T&&,const Widget&&>::value)
    {
        std::cout << "T&& = const Widget&&\n";
    }
}

int main()
{
    Widget w;
    const Widget cw;

    std::cout << "Calling f(w)\n"; 
    f(w);
    std::cout << "Calling f(cw)\n"; 
    f(cw);
    std::cout << "Calling f(std::move(w))\n"; 
    f(std::move(w));
    std::cout << "Calling f(std::move(cw))\n"; 
    f(std::move(cw));
    return 0;
}
```
[Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/z/759ebbErr)

stdout:
```
Calling f(w)
T&& = Widget&
Calling f(cw)
T&& = const Widget&
Calling f(std::move(w))
T&& = Widget&&
Calling f(std::move(cw))
T&& = const Widget&&
```

By rule, the template parameter type `T`, is deduced to be:

- An *lvalue* reference if we pass an *lvalue*.
- An *rvalue* reference if we pass to an *rvalue*.

Note that, a generic *rvalue* reference that is qualified with `const` (or `volatile`) is **not** a universal reference. 

The rules of *reference collapsing* are now applied:

- `Widget& &&` becomes `Widget&`
- `Widget&& &` becomes `Widget&`
- `Widget& &&` becomes `Widget &`
- `Widget&& &&` becomes `Widget&&`

In the function call `f( w )`, we are passing an *lvalue*, so the template parameter `T` is deduced to be an *lvalue reference*, `Widget&`. Therefore, `T&&` is `Widget& &&` and by the rules of reference collapsing, this collapses to `Widget&`.

Similarly, in the function call `f( Widget{} )`, we are passing an *rvalue*, so the template parameter `T` is deduced to be an *rvalue reference*, `Widget&&`. Therefore, `T&&` is `Widget&& &&` which collapses to `Widget&&`. 

#### `std::forward<>()`

`std::forward<>()` conditionally casts its input into an *rvalue* reference. 

- If the given input expression is an *lvalue*, it is cast to an *lvalue* reference.
- If the given input expression is an *rvalue*, it is cast to an *rvalue* reference.

`std::forward` does not forward anything. 

A really cool use-case of perfect forwarding is the `std::make_unique()` function. `std::make_unique<T>()` must invoke the underlying constructor. However, whilst doing so, it must preserve the const-ness and the value category of the arguments passed to the constructor. 

Here is a quick code snippet:

```cpp
// Let's say that we would like to implement the make_unique()
// function that invokes the underlying constructor - either move
// or copy based on the arguments
#include <memory>
#include <iostream>

class X{
    public:
        X(){}
        X(const X& x){ std::cout << "copy c'tor\n";}
        X(X&& x) { std::cout << "move c'tor\n"; }
};


template<typename T, typename... Args>
std::unique_ptr<T> make_unique(Args&&... args){
    T* ptr_t = new T(std::forward<Args>(args)...);
    return std::unique_ptr<T>(ptr_t);
}

int main()
{
    X x1{};
    std::unique_ptr<X> x2{make_unique<X>(x1)};  //calls X(const X&)
    std::unique_ptr<X> x3{make_unique<X>(X{})}; //calls X(X&&)
    return 0;
}
```

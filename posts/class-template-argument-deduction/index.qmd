## Function Template Argument Deduction.

Its super-helpful to have a good low-level hang of the template argument deduction rules (more on deduction guides in another post). Essentially, since C++17, you can just declare, `std::vector{1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0}` - clean and nice instead of `std::vector<double>{1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0}`.

When the compiler tries to deduce the template arguments, it performs matching of the type template parameters with the types of arguments used to invoke the function. 

Very succinctly, the compiler can match:
- Types of the form 𝚃, 𝚃 𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚜𝚝, 𝚃 𝚟𝚘𝚕𝚊𝚝𝚒𝚕𝚎
- Pointers 𝚃*, lvalue references 𝚃& and universal references 𝚃&&
- Arrays such as 𝚃[𝟻]
- Pointers to functions 
- Pointers to member-functions and data-members.

## CTAD (Class Template Argument Deduction).

### The basic mechanics.

CTAD(Class Template Argument Deduction) has $2$ phases:

1.  Deduction (CTAD) - The first step is, the compiler is going to
    deduce the types that you didn't write.

2.  Initialization - The second step is, it's going to initialize the
    object.

Let's take a templated class `pair`, this is just a fictional class, it
is not actually how `std::pair<>` looks like:

::: tcolorbox
``` {.cpp breaklines=""}
template<typename T, typename U>
struct pair{
    T first;
    U second;

    pair(const T& _first, const U& _second) 
    : first(_first)
    , second(_second)
    {}

    pair(T&& _first, U&& _second) 
    : first(std::move<T>(_first))
    , second(std::move<U>(_second))
    {}

    //other stuff
};
```
:::

This is an oversimplification that is enough for our purposes. So, you
have a templated class with two template parameters `T` and `U` and then
you have a bunch of constructors. Now, we want to instantiate one of
these things:

``` {.cpp breaklines=""}
pair p1{"OptionVolQuote"s, 0.50};
```

You want to construct an object of type `pair`. The next thing the
compiler sees is, `pair` is a template. And we didn't specify any
template arguments. Probably, you *wanna* do class template argument
deduction.

The next thing happens. `pair` has a bunch of constructors. Probably,
you *wanna* call one of those constructors. And this where step 1 kicks
in, which is the actual *Class Template Argument Deduction*(CTAD).

So, how does the compiler figure out, what you actually want to
instantiate? So, it's going to look at those constructors. Let's pretend
for a minute, that those constructors are ordinary functions - just
free-standing functions. Now, these functions use class template
parameters. Let's pretend for a moment, that those template parameters
are template parameters for the function.

::: tcolorbox
``` {.cpp breaklines=""}
template<typename T, typename U>
struct pair{
    T first;
    U second;

    // Imagine this to be a function template
    template<typename T, typename U>  
    pair(const T& _first, const T& _second) 
    : first(_first)
    , second(_second)
    {}

    // Imagine this to be a function template
    template<typename T, typename U>
    pair(T&& _first, U&& _second) 
    : first(std::move<T>(_first))
    , second(std::move<U>(_second))
    {}

    //other stuff
};
```
:::

So, this code doesn't exist. It's just what the compiler temporarily
does for you. And it generates these template functions from the
constructors and they are called the *deduction candidates*.

And now, if we have a call like this:

::: tcolorbox
``` {.cpp breaklines=""}
pair p1{"OptionVolQuote"s, 0.50};
```
:::

we know, how to deal with functions right. So, it's going to look at
these functions and apply the usual template arguments deduction and the
usual overload resolution.

`"OptionVolQuote"s` is a *lvalue* that gets converted to an *xvalue* (by
the `std::string()` constructor) and `0.50` is a *prvalue*. these
arguments bind to universal references. So, the `pair(T&&, U&&)` version
is chosen by the compiler from the overload set, during overload
resolution. Further, `T` is deduced as `std::string` and `U` is deduced
as `double`. The compiler literally inserts them as:

::: tcolorbox
``` {.cpp breaklines=""}
pair<std::string,double> p1{"OptionVolQuote"s, 0.50};
```
:::

Then, its going to do, what it would have done, if you would have
written `pair<std::string,double>`. So, now we know, that this `pair` is
actually `pair<std::string,int>`. So, the step 1 is done.

Now, what we can do is, we can actually instantiate the function
template! That's step 2. So, you have an actual constructor and it will
be called by the run-time to create an object of
`pair<std::string,int>`. And we are done.

If we write:

::: tcolorbox
``` {.cpp breaklines=""}
const auto s{"5YSwapRate"s};
const auto rate{0.0125};
pair p2{s,rate};
```
:::

Here, `s` and `rate` are identifiers, so these are *glvalues* and can
bind to `const T&`. So, the compiler instantiates the first overload of
the constructor as `pair(const std::string&, const double&)`.

There's no need to use `std::make_pair` anymore. This `make_pair` thing
is a basically a work-around for the fact that up until C++14, you could
only do this with functions. So, you had to use a function to deduce the
class template arguments. So, it was kind of hacky. And now we don't
need to use that anymore.

The same goes for `std::tuple`, you can instantiate a `std::tuple` with
a bunch of arguments and it's going to deduce the correct types for you,
so you don't need to use `std::make_tuple` anymore.

::: tcolorbox
``` {.cpp breaklines=""}
std::tuple point{1.00, -1.00}
```
:::

Let's look at `std::vector`. So, for example, if you just give it an
`std::initializer_list` of `int`s, its gonna correctly deduce back to
`std::vector<int>`.

::: tcolorbox
``` {.cpp breaklines=""}
std::vector v{3, 5, 7, 11, 13};
// deduces std::vector<int>
```
:::

Of course, with `std::vector`, there's a trap. `std::vector` has this
other constructor which takes a `std::size_t`, and it initializes a
vector with that many elements in it.

::: tcolorbox
``` {.cpp breaklines=""}
std::vector<int> v1{3};
// content is {3}

std::vector<int> v2(3);
// content is {0,0,0}
```
:::

So, in C++14, if you write `std::vector<int> v{3}` with curly braces,
it's going to be an initializer list, so its going to initialize the
vector with one `int`, which is `3`. If you `std::vector<int> v(3)` with
parenthesis, it's going to call the `size_t` constructor, and you're
gonna have 3 `int`s, which are initialized to `0.0`.

Now, what happens if you omit the `int` and use class-template argument
deduction? Then if you write the curlies, its going to do the deduction.
But if you use round parenthesis, it says, well you're calling the
constructor that takes a `size_t`, so you are going to have 3 elements,
but 3 elements of what type? You didn't specify! So, you get a compiler
error.

::: tcolorbox
``` {.cpp breaklines=""}
std::vector v1{3};
// Ok- deduces std::vector<int>, content is {3}

// std::vector v2(3);
// Error : 3 elements of what?
```
:::

`std::vector` has another constructor, which is really cool! Now, some
real magic happens here! So, if you have a range of `int`s, any range,
then there's this constructor that takes a pair of iterators like
`begin()` and `end()` and if you don't specify the `int`, it is still
going to figure out, that those iterators are iterators to `int` range
and it is going correctly deduce `std::vector<int>` for you.

::: tcolorbox
``` {.cpp breaklines=""}
std::vector range{2, 3, 5, 7, 11};
std::vector v(range.begin(), range.end());
// deduces std::vector<int>
```
:::

How does that work? It has this constructor which looks like the below.
It takes two iterators.

::: tcolorbox
``` {.cpp breaklines=""}
template<typename T>
struct vector
{
    // range c'tor
    template<typename Iter>
    vector<Iter begin, Iter end> { /* ... */ }

    // other stuff
};
```
:::

If you have a constructor that also has template arguments, the compiler
is going to pretend that this is a function and it's going to take the
template argument of the class and concatenate it with the constructor's
template argument. It's going to put them one after the other.

::: tcolorbox
``` {.cpp breaklines=""}
// This is magic code, generated by the compiler
template<typename T>
struct vector
{
    // range c'tor
    template<typename T, typename Iter>
    vector<Iter begin, Iter end> { /* ... */ }

    // other stuff
};
```
:::

Now, if you call it like this:

::: tcolorbox
``` {.cpp breaklines=""}
std::vector range{2, 3, 5, 7, 11};
std::vector v(range.begin(), range.end());
```
:::

it's going to say, well okay, you are giving me two iterators, so I can
deduce the type of iterators as `std::vector<>::iterator`. But, you
didn't specify `T`, so I still don't know what `T` is. So, how is it
able to figure this out?

# Deduction Guides.

This is another feature called deduction guides. When the compiler can't
figure out, with this machinery, what the type is, but it is kind of
obvious to you, what the type should be, you can write a deduction
guide.

::: tcolorbox
``` {.cpp breaklines=""}
template<typename T>
struct vector
{
    // range c'tor
    template<typename Iter>
    vector<Iter begin, Iter end> { /* ... */ }

    // other stuff
};

// deduction guide:
template <typename Iter>
vector(Iter begin, Iter end) 
    -> vector<typename Iter::iterator_traits<Iter>::value_type>;

std::vector range{2, 3, 5, 7, 11};
std::vector v(range.begin(), range.end());
```
:::

It starts with something that looks like a constructor signature, and
then you have this arrow `->` and after the arrow, you put like a
specialization of the same class. So, you are gonna say, well, if you
have this constructor signature (which will be added to the deduction
candidates), and if this is the one that is going to be selected by the
compiler, then deduce the type after the arrow (`->`). So, this is like
a new entity in C++17. It's not a class, it's not a function, it's a
*deduction guide*.

With that deduction guide, basically you're saying, well, if I get two
iterators, then take the iterator traits, figure out the value type
which this iterator points to and initialize the vector with that type.
And that works and compiles.

So, this compiles, but actually the order matters. Deductions guides are
only considered for the code that is below the deduction guide.

So, if you flip around the order:

::: tcolorbox
``` {.cpp breaklines=""}
template<typename T>
struct vector
{
    // range c'tor
    template<typename Iter>
    vector<Iter begin, Iter end> { /* ... */ }

    // other stuff
};

std::vector range{2, 3, 5, 7, 11};
//std::vector v(range.begin(), range.end());
// Error: deduction failed

// deduction guide:
template <typename Iter>
vector(Iter begin, Iter end) 
    -> vector<typename Iter::iterator_traits<Iter>::value_type>;
```
:::

then it's not going to work anymore.

One thing that's really a good recommendation, is that these deduction
guides are really part of the class interface. Because they tell you,
you can instantiate this class template like this, so *deduction guides
should be defined immediately after the class definition*.

## List initialization has priority

You really have to be careful with the parenthesis and the curlies.

::: tcolorbox
``` {.cpp breaklines=""}
std::vector range{2, 3, 5, 7, 11};
std::vector v(range.begin(), range.end());
// deduces std::vector<int>

std::vector v{range.begin(), range.end()};
// list initialization has a priority, so the compiler deduces it
// as std::vector<std::vector<int>::iterator>, which is 
// probably not what we want
```
:::

# Sequence Containers

CTAD works the same with all the other sequence containers.

::: tcolorbox
``` {.cpp breaklines=""}
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <list>
#include <deque>
#include <array>
#include <forward_list>

int main()
{
    std::list l{2, 3, 5, 7, 11};
    //deduces std::list<int>

    std::forward_list fl{2, 3, 5, 7, 11};
    //deduces std::forward_list<int>

    std::deque d{2, 3, 5, 7, 11};
    //deduces std::deque<int>

    std::array a{2, 3, 5, 7, 11};
    //deduces std::array<int,5>
    return 0;
}
```
:::

[Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/z/d74a8c4f5)

With `std::array<T,N>` it also deduces the size for you. We are going to
see later, how that works. They also have these range constructors
except for `std::array<T,N>`.

::: tcolorbox
``` {.cpp breaklines=""}
std::vector range{2, 3, 5, 7, 11};

std::list l(range.begin(), range.end());
// deduces std::list<int>

std::forward_list fl(range.begin(), range.end());
// deduces std::foward_list<int>

std::deque d(range.begin(), range.end());
// deduces std::deque<int>

// also, the same pitfall - don't use curly braces
```
:::

Then, there is `std::set`. `std::set` also has both of these
constructors. But, `std::set` also has more stuff. You know, `std::set`
has this external template parameter which is the comparison function,
so you can specify your own comparator lambda. And that's a template
argument. But, the cool thing is, `std::set` also has a constructor,
that takes this comparator as a template argument and it can deduce that
as well. So, we can actually write something like this:

::: tcolorbox
``` {.cpp breaklines=""}
std::set s({2, 3, 5, 7, 11}, [](int a, int b){return a > b;});
```
:::

Notice that you don't have to pass the type of the lambda
`bool (int,int)`, the compiler will automatically deduce it for you.

# Locks and Mutexes.

One of the most popular use-cases for CTAD is mutexes. When you have
long type names like `std::shared_timed_mutex mtx` and then if you had
to lock it, you had to specify this thing:
`std::lock_guard<std::shared_timed_mutex> lock(mtx)`. With C++17, you
don't have to do that anymore:

::: tcolorbox
``` {.cpp breaklines=""}
std::shared_timed_mutex mtx;
std::lock_guard lock(mtx);
// deduced as std::lock_guard<std::shared_timed_mutex>
```
:::

# Smart Pointers.

This is one of the prime examples, where class template argument
deduction can be dangerous and damaging. Let's say you have a
`struct Citizen` with some constructor. And, then you want to create a
`Citizen` instance dynamically on the heap. You would maybe expect to
write:

::: tcolorbox
``` {.cpp breaklines=""}
struct Citizen{
    //c'tor
    Citizen(std::string prefix, int serial_number);
};

// std::shared_ptr sptr(new Citizen("THX",1138);
// Error! No CTAD

auto sptr = std::make_shared<Citizen>("THX",1138);
```
:::

You give it a pointer to this dynamically allocated `Citizen` object,
and then you think it's going to work. But, that fails and for good
reason! It's specifically disabled. So, you're back to using
`make_shared<T>` again. The same with `std::unique_ptr<T>`.

::: tcolorbox
``` {.cpp breaklines=""}
// std::unique_ptr sptr(new Citizen("THX",1138);
// Error! No CTAD

auto uptr = std::make_unique<Citizen>("THX",1138);
```
:::

It's not going to the deduce the type `T`; you have to use
`make_unique<T>`.

There's good reasons for this. First of all, `make_shared<T>` has
exception safety built in. If for some reason, the constructor fails and
`throw`s, then you are not going to leak memory.

Secondly, if you have an array, and you pass it to a constructor, it
decays into a pointer. If you had class-template argument deduction
smart-pointers, you could write like that:

::: tcolorbox
``` {.cpp breaklines=""}
// std::unique_ptr uptr(new int[10]);
// if that would compile, uh-oh!
```
:::

A pointer to an array would decay to a pointer to an `int` for you. When
the pointer goes out of scope, the destructor of `std::shared_ptr` calls
`delete` on `sptr` and not `delete[]`.

This is definitely a bug! We don't want people to be able to use CTAD
here.

We would like to disable CTAD. Now, the question is how do we disable
it? How do we make sure that it doesn't work.

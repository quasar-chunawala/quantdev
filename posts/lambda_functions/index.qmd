# Introduction

I've got my hands on the [C++ lambda story](https://leanpub.com/cpplambda) by [Bartłomiej Filipek](https://leanpub.com/u/fenbf) and want to try out a few of the examples. 

## Lambdas in C++11

An example of the most minimal lambda expression is:

```cpp
// 1. the simplest lambda
[]{};
```

`[]` section is called the lambda introducer and the empty `{}` part is for the function body.

```cpp
// with a parameter
auto area = [](double radius){
    return std::pi * radius * radius;
}
```

The arguments are passed into a lambda function like any regular function. The return type is not needed as the compiler will automatically deduce it.

```cpp
auto norm = [](std::vector<double> v) -> double{
    double result{0};
    for(auto i{0uz}; i < v.size(); ++i)
    {
        result += v[i] * v[i];
    }
    return sqrt(result);
}
```

In the above example, we explicitly set a return type. The trailing return type is also available for regular function declaration since C++11.

```cpp
auto f = [x](double a, double b) mutable{
    ++x;
    return a < b;
};

auto g = [](float param) noexcept{
    rrtutn param * param;
};

auto h = [](int a, int b) mutable noexcept{
    ++x;
    return a < b;
};
```

Before the body of the lambda, you can use other specifiers. In the code, we used `mutable` (so that we can change the captured variable) and also `noexcept`. The third lambda uses `mutable` and `noexcept` and they have to appear in that order (you cannot write `noexcept mutable` as the compiler will reject it).

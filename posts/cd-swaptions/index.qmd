# Standard CDS pricing theory

The pricing mechanism I summarize below is quite standard and can be found in O'Kane.

## CDS

A *Credit Default Swap*(CDS) is a form of insurance against the default of a debt issuing entity. The protection lasts for a specified period and if the reference entity defaults in this period, the protection buyer receives a payment from the protection seller. In return, the buyer of the protection makes regular premium payments to the protection seller. The payments cancel in the event of a default.

To expand further, a CDS contract is made between two parties - the protection buyer and the protection seller. The buyer of the protection makes regular (quarterly) premium paments to the protection seller, until the expiry of the CDS contract or the reference obligor suffers a default(if this occurs first). For a particular period, there is an accrual start date, $s_i$, an accrual end date $t_i$, a payment date $p_i$. 

### The Coupons

Like the Interest Rate Swaps(IRS), CDSs originally traded at par, that is, they were constructed to have zero cost of entry. The market view on the credit quality of reference obligor was reflected in the coupon or the *par spread*. Since the coupon was then fixed, the CDS could have positive or negative mark-to-market value (MtM) throughout its lifetime, depending on the market's updated view of the credit quality.

Following the credit crisis, all CDS contracts now have a standard coupon and an upfront charge, quoted as a percentage of the notional - *Points Upfront*. This amount is quoted as if it is paid by the protection buyer. However, it can be negative, in which case, it is paid to the protection buyer.

### Credit Curves

In CDS pricing, credit default events are modelled using a Poisson process, with an intensity (or hazard rate) $\lambda(t)$. If the default time is $\tau$, then the probability of default over an infinitesimal time period $dt$, given no default to $t$ is:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}(t < \tau < t + dt | \tau > t) = \lambda(t)dt
\end{align*}
$$ {#eq-instantaneous probability of default}

The probability of surviving to at least time $T > t$ (assuming no default has occurred until time $t$) is given by:

$$
\begin{align*}
Q(t,T) = \mathbb{P}(\tau > T | \tau > t) = \mathbb{E}[1_{\tau > T}|\mathcal{F}_t] = \exp\left(-\lambda(s)ds\right)
\end{align*}
$$ {#eq-survival-probability-deterministic-intensity}

Up until this point, we have assumed that the intensity is deterministic - if it is extended to be a stochastic process, then the survival probability is given by:

$$
\begin{align*}
Q(t,T) = \mathbb{E}\left[e^{-\int_{t}^T \lambda(s)ds}|\mathcal{F}_t\right]
\end{align*}
$${#eq-survival-probability-stochastic-intensity}

It is quite clear that the survival probability $Q(t,T)$ plays the same role as the discounting factor (risk-free zero-coupon bond) $P(t,T)$, as is the intensity $\lambda(t)$ and the instantaneous short rate $r(t)$. We may extend this analogy and define the forward hazard rate $h(t,T)$ as:

$$
\begin{align*}
Q(t,T) = e^{-\int_{t}^T h(t,s) ds} \implies h(t,s) = -\frac{\partial}{\partial s}(\ln Q(t,s)) = -\frac{1}{Q(t,s)} \frac{\partial Q(t,s)}{\partial s}
\end{align*}
$${#eq-forward-hazard-rate}

and the zero hazard rates $\Lambda(t,T)$ as:

$$
\begin{align*}
Q(t,T) = e^{-(T-t)\Lambda(t,T)}, \quad \Lambda(t,T) = -\frac{1}{T-t}\ln[Q(t,T)]
\end{align*}
$${#eq-zero-hazard-rate}

The survival probability curve $Q(t,T)$, the forward hazard rate curve $h(t,T)$ and the zero hazard rate curve $\Lambda(t,T)$ are equivalent and we refer to them generically as credit curves.

The forward hazard rate represents the (infinitesimal) probability of default between times $T$ and $T+dt$, conditional on survival to time $T$ as seen from time $t < T$. The unconditional probability of default between times $T$ and $T+dT$ (as seen from time $t$) is given by:

$$
\mathbb{P}(T < \tau \leq T + dT | \tau > t ) = Q(t,T)h(t)
$$

## Pricing a CDS

### The Protection Leg

THe protection leg of a CDS consists of a (random) payment of $N(1 - RR(\tau))$ at default time $\tau$ if this is before expiry of the CDS (time $T$) and nothing otherwise. The present value of this leg can be written as:

$$
\begin{align*}
PV_{prot} = N \mathbb{E}[e^{-\int_0^\tau r(s) ds} (1 - RR(\tau))1_{\tau < T}]
\end{align*}
$${#eq-pv-protection-leg-1}

Under the assumption of a flat recovery curve, this can be rewritten as:

$$
\begin{align*}
PV_{prot} = N(1-RR)\mathbb{E}[e^{-\int_0^\tau r(s) ds} 1_{\tau < T}]
\end{align*}
$${#eq-pv-protection-leg-2}

Consider first a contract that pays $N(1-RR)$, if the default takes place in the small time interval $[u,u+du]$. The value of this cash-flow at time $0$:

$$
N(1-RR)\mathbb{E}[e^{-\int_0^u r(s)ds } 1_{\tau\in[u,u+du]}]
$$

We can rewrite it as:

$$
N(1-RR)\mathbb{E}[e^{-\int_0^u r(s)ds } 1_{\tau\in[u,u+du]}] = N(1-RR)\mathbb{E}[ \lambda(u) e^{-\int_0^u (r(s) + \lambda(s))ds }] 
$$

Integrating over $u$ from $0$ to $T$, we find that:

$$
V_{prot}(0,T) = N(1-RR)\mathbb{E}\left[\int_0^T \lambda(s) e^{-\int_0^s (r(u) + \lambda(u))du} ds \right]
$$

If the short rate process and the credit default intensity processes are independent, we can write this expression as:

$$
V_{prot}(0,T) = N(1-RR) \int_0^T  P(0,s) Q(0,s)\lambda(s) ds
$$

The last integral can be easily approximated numerically.

### The premium leg

Consider now the premium leg of a CDS maturing at $T$ with the premium consisting of the periodic coupon payments only (no upfront fee). 

The premium leg consists of two parts : Regular premium (or coupon) payments (e.g. every three months) up to the expiry of the CDS, which cease if a default occurs, and a single payment of the accrued premium in the event of a default.

If there are $M$ remaining payments, with payment times $t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_i,\ldots,t_M$, period end times $e_1,e_2,\ldots,e_M$ and year fractions $\Delta_1, \Delta_2,\ldots,\Delta_M$, then the present value of the premiums only is:

$$
V_{\text{premiums-only}}(0,T) = NC\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{i=1}^M \Delta_i e^{-\int_0^{t_i} r(s) ds 1_{e_i < \tau}}\right] = NC\sum_{i=1}^M \Delta_i P(0,t_i) Q(0,e_i)
$${#eq-pv-premiums-only}

## Forward Starting CDS

A forward starting CDS entered into at time $t$ will give protection against the default of an obligor for the period $T_e > t$ to $T_m$, in return for premium payments in that period. If the obligor defaults before the start of the protection $\tau < T_e$, the contract cancels worthless. This can easily be replicated by entering a long protection CDS with maturity $T_m$, and a short protection position with maturity $T_e$, leaving only the coupons between $T_e$ and $T_m$ to pay. Furthermore, if a default occurs before $T_e$, the protection payments will exactly cancel. 

$$
V(t,T_e, T_m) = V(t, T_m) - V(t,T_e)
$$

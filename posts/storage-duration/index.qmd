# Introduction

# Storage Duration

The storage duration of an object defines the lifetime of the storage containing the object. 

In C++, the storage duration of the object can be:

- Static
- Thread
- Automatic
- Dynamic 

For an object with *static* storage duration:
- The storage is allocated at program startup.
- The storage persists until the program is terminated.

For an object with *thread* storage duration:
- The storage is allocated when the thread begins.
- THe storage persists until the thread terminates.

For an object with automatic storage duration:
- The storage is allocated when the enclosing block begins executing. This is usually upon entering the enclosing function.
- The storage persists until the block terminates. This is usally upon function return.

For an object with dynamic storage duration:
- The storage is allocated on the heap by a call to a memory allocation function e.g. `std::malloc`, `operator new` or the new expression.
- The storage on the heap is deallocated by `std::free`, `operator delete` or the delete expression.

# Linkage

The *linkage* of a name is the extent to which that name might refer to a name declared elsewhere. C++ provides for three categories of linkage:

- external linkage
- internal linkage
- no linkage

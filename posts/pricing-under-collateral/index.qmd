# Collateralized Discounting

## Introduction

In the past, standard derivatives pricing theory assumed the existence of a **risk-free rate** for derivatives discounting. Until the global financial crisis(GFC), this assumption worked well, but has since been replaced by *Collateral adjusted valuation*(CAV). **Collateralized discounting** is standard practice on derivatives trading desks. 

A risk-neutral measure can still be defined and much of the pricing technology developed in the traditional setting can be reused.

The theoretical foundations of collateralized discounting are the papers [Cooking with collateral](http://janroman.dhis.org/finance/Kreditrisk/Risk_Cooking%20with%20collateralpdf.pdf) and [Funding beyond Discounting](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vladimir-Piterbarg-2/publication/284078682_Funding_beyond_Discounting_Collateral_Agreements_and_Derivatives_Pricing/links/614c85a9a595d06017e55b0e/Funding-beyond-Discounting-Collateral-Agreements-and-Derivatives-Pricing.pdf) by Piterbarg. I summarize the main arguments here.

## Pricing under collateral

We set up a self-financing portfolio $\Pi$  that is comprised of one derivative worth $V(t)$, an amount $\theta_1$ of the underlying $X$, an amount $\theta_2$ of funding account $B_f(t)$ and an amount $\theta_3$ of collateral account $B_c(t)$. The value of the portfolio at time $t$ is $\Pi(t) = V(t) + \theta_1(t) X(t) + \theta_2(t) B_f(t) + \theta_3(t) B_c(t)$.

The self-financing assumption implies that:

$$
d\Pi = dV + \theta_1 dX_t + \theta_2 dB_f(t) + \theta_3 dB_c(t)
$$

# A quick refresher

A quanto option is any cash-settled option whose payoff is converted into another currency at a pre-specified rate $Q$  at maturity.

I take the example of gold quoted as $XAU/USD$ that is quantoed in $INR$. 

Define :

$$
\begin{align*}
S_T &:= \text{Price of gold in domestic currency} \\
X_T &:= \text{Price of the foreign currency in domestic currency terms}\\
K &:= \text{Strike expressed in foreign currency terms}\\
Q &:= \text{Pre-specified conversion factor}
\end{align*}
$$

Since the payoff is in $INR$, we take $INR$ as the domestic currency or numeraire in the Black-Scholes model. 

Then, the payoff of the quanto-call option is:

$$
V_T = Q\left(\frac{S_T}{X_T} - K\right)^{+}
$$

$S_T/X_T$ has units $\frac{XAU}{USD}$, and $Q$ - the pre-specified conversion factor has units $\frac{USD}{INR}$.

# The Setup

The domestic risk-neutral measure $Q^{INR}$ is the probability measure linked to the domestic money-market account $M_T^{INR}$. 

The foreign risk-neutral measure $Q^{USD}$ is the probability measure linked to the foreign money-market account expressed in domestic currency terms, $(M_T^{USD} \cdot X_T)$. $M_T^{USD}$ has units $USD^{-1}$ and $X_T$ has units $USD \cdot INR^{-1}$.

Consider the Black-Scholes model:

$$
\begin{align*}
{XAU/INR : } \quad dS_t &= r_{INR} S_t dt + \sigma_S S_t dW_{S}^{Q^{INR}}(t) \\
{USD/INR : } \quad dX_t &= (r_{INR} - r_{USD})X_t dt + \sigma_X X(t) dW_X^{Q^{INR}}(t)\\
dW_{S}^{Q^{INR}}(t) \cdot dW_X^{Q^{INR}}(t) &= \rho_{S,X} dt
\end{align*}
$$

where $(W^{Q^{INR}}(t),t\geq 0)$ is a $Q^{INR}$-standard brownian motion. 

# The evolution of the underlying XAU-USD

The actual underlying is :

$$
\text{XAU/USD } := \frac{S(t)}{X(t)}
$$

Using Ito's formula, we obtain:

$$
\begin{align*}
d\left(\frac{1}{X_t}\right) &= -\frac{1}{X_t^2}dX_t + \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{2}{X_t^3} (dX_t)^2 \\
&= -\frac{1}{X_t}[(r_{INR} - r_{USD}) dt + \sigma_X dW_X^{Q^{INR}}(t)] + \frac{1}{X_t}\sigma_X^2 dt\\
&= \frac{1}{X_t} [(\sigma_X^2 + r_{USD} - r_{INR}) dt - \sigma_X dW_X^{Q^{INR}}(t)]
\end{align*}
$$
